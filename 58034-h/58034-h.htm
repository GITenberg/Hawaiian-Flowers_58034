</div>
<p>The working title of this book during its preparation was
that question so often on the lips of tourists in Hawaii,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What flower is that?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had there still been tourists in Honolulu, it is likely that
that name would have been used on the cover, for the book is
designed to help answer it. Now that the islands are filled with
visitors intent on more serious business than pleasure, it has
seemed best to call it simply &ldquo;Hawaiian Flowers.&rdquo; It is published
at this time in the hope that some of these visitors may find in
it an hour&rsquo;s escape from the strain and pressure of war. For, in
spite of war, the flowers still bloom in Honolulu, often right over
the bomb shelters that fill gardens and parks.</p>
<p>In using the book to help identify the island flowers, it is
hoped that the color plates and descriptions together, will make
it fairly easy for the layman. Persons interested in more serious
study will know how to go to more technical works for information.
Care has been taken to have each name accurate to aid those
going to the accepted authorities.</p>
<p>In making the color plates the attempt has been made to
have them both artistic and scientific, a difficult undertaking
under any circumstances. In striving to present pictures of individual
flowers so they may be identified, it has been necessary,
at times, to sacrifice the gorgeous effects presented in nature by
masses of these flowers; such, for instance, as is seen on the
Shower trees. The writers wish to take this opportunity to thank
<span class="pb" id="Page_ii">ii</span>
Ted Mundorff, the artist, for his trouble in making the reproductions
as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>They wish, also, to express appreciation to Mr. Edward L.
Caum, botanist with the Hawaiian Sugar Planters&rsquo; Experiment
Station, for reading the manuscript and checking the botanical
information it contains. Mrs. Arthur Silverman, in the Library
of Hawaii, has been most helpful in looking up obscure references.</p>
<p>Works consulted in preparing the book include Rock&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ornamental Trees of Hawaii,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Indigenous Trees of
Hawaii&rdquo;; Marie Neal&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;In Honolulu Gardens&rdquo; and Bailey&rsquo;s
Cyclopedia of Horticulture.</p>

<br />WHERE TO SEE HAWAIIAN FLOWERS?</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i03.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="200" height="200" />
</div>
<p>If you are already in Hawaii, this question will seem
purely rhetorical, since the answer is so obviously, &ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
There are few places indeed, in the islands,
where flowers of some sort are not in sight. Mostly, of
course, these are the Hibiscus, but you will soon notice others
and the quest for new ones is apt to develop into a full-sized hobby.
For the benefit of newcomers, a few of the gardens, parks and
drives where you will find many Hawaiian trees and flowers are
given here. By the time you have covered these places, you will
know how to go on by yourself.</p>
<h3>ROYAL HAWAIIAN HOTEL GARDEN</h3>
<p>Few finer, tropical gardens can be found in the Islands than
the one which forms a setting for the Royal Hawaiian Hotel at
Waikiki. Not only does it contain a very large assortment of
trees, shrubs and special tropical plants, many of them rare, but
it has been laid out to make the very most of the charm inherent
in the words &ldquo;tropical garden.&rdquo; There are cool, green, jungle
depths, gorgeous blossoms and wide shady lawns, all beautifully
maintained.</p>
<p>To see these gardens it is best to start at the hotel steps,
facing the coconut grove. This particular group of palms probably
contains the oldest ones in Honolulu, some of the tallest,
slender trees being estimated at well over a hundred years in age.
Hawaiian kings kept their surf boards in the shade of these trees.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
In the early days, indeed, they were almost the only trees of any
kind in the city. Old pictures show a dusty, sun-baked expanse
between Honolulu harbor and Waikiki, with this grove standing
up conspicuously. The luxuriant green growth of gardens which
now mantles Honolulu is something comparatively recent in its
existence, the result of a water system and an interest in gardens.</p>
<p>Near the steps and terrace of the hotel you will find plants
with colored foliage including Crotons, red-leaved Tis and the
Beefsteak plant. The fountain is surrounded with Lauae fern
(<i>Polypodium phymatodes</i>) and near it grow the heart-shaped
leaves of Caladiums and A&rsquo;pes, (pronounced ah-pays). This is
the Hawaiian word for various plants of the Taro family.</p>
<p>To the left of the fountain stands a magnificent specimen
of a Monkeypod tree, throwing out its giant branches over a
wide expanse of lawn. Beyond it is a Bengal banyan, (<i>Ficus bengalensis</i>),
with bunches of aerial roots dangling from the branches.
When they touch the ground they develop into secondary trunks.</p>
<p>The arbor is covered with Crimson Lake Bougainvillea. In
the plantings around it you can find the shrubs illustrated on
<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>, for the flowers pictured on it were gathered at this spot.</p>
<p>Further along, to the right, is a Pink and White Shower
tree, a Golden Shower and an Octopus tree. The latter, (<i>Brassaia
actinophylla</i>), can be identified by its radiating, octopus-like
arms, covered with dark red buds or blossoms. There is also a
Hala or Pandanus in this area.</p>
<p>Walking across the lawn and turning left, you pass the thick
border of Oleander and Hibiscus shrubs which screen out the
street. In this section may be found a Royal Poinciana, a Potato
tree, a Kukui and some Breadfruit trees, (<i>Artocarpus incisa</i>).
You can tell the latter by their very large, deeply lobed, oblong
leaves, and the rough, round, green fruit, about the size of a
muskmelon, which grows on the ends of the branches. This fruit,
when baked, tastes something like a sweet potato. Here is also a
Pomegranate tree and beyond are Bananas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Turning again to the left you enter the real tropical garden,
a cool, green, jungle under the second coconut grove. Some of
the trunks of these palms are enwrapped in the great green and
gold leaves of the Pothos or Philodendron vine. Growing under
the tall palms are lesser ones, along with bamboos and tree ferns.
The latter have soft, fibrous, brown trunks with three or four
very large, typical, fern-leaves growing out of the top. The paths
hereabouts are bordered with more of the Lauae fern and with
Begonias and Anthuriums, while green and red Ti plants and A&rsquo;pes
fill in the background. If you keep somewhat to the left, you
approach the hotel building again, where you will find the Torch
Gingers and Red Gingers serving as a base planting.</p>
<p>As you pass beyond the building you can see a Tiger&rsquo;s Claw
tree and over to the right, near the road, a Plumeria. Planted
around here are Spider Lilies and Shell Gingers. Near the side door
of the hotel are Tecomarias or Cape Honeysuckle, and nearby is
a glowing African Tulip tree.</p>
<p>The wide grassy cove that fills the curve of the building
beyond is bordered by a very fine collection of Hibiscus. Trees
in this area include the Yellow Poinciana, more Shower trees and,
across the lawn, an old specimen of the Papaya. This has a smooth
trunk marked by the leaf scars. The leaves grow out stiffly, on
long stems, near the top. The fruit grows directly out of the
main trunk.</p>
<p>If you cross the driveway and follow the walk, starting near
the entrance, that leads to the tennis courts, you will pass a different
assortment of trees and shrubs, those that like sun and not
too much water. Date palms have thick, grey-green fronds and
rough, stubby trunks. There are pink Plumerias, a Chinese Rice
Flower tree, a Milo and Be-still trees. Near the tennis court is a
Jacaranda and some Lime trees, and at the very end are both purple
and white flowering Orchid trees. Near the Sports Office you
can find Jatropha shrubs, the Caricature plant and the red and
yellow Pride of Barbadoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Returning to the hotel you pass one of the most common
trees in the island, the Kiawe or Algaroba, (<i>Prosopis chilensis</i>).
It is a spreading, light-foliaged tree, often twisted picturesquely.
It has fine, bipinnate leaves, small spikes of tiny, yellow flowers
and yellow, bean-like pods. These trees now cover large areas of
the island, although the seed of the original tree was brought here
in 1828 by the Catholic missionary, Father Bachelot. They are
natives of tropical America.</p>
<p>Bordering the drive at the rear of the hotel you can find
the Lobster Claw, (<i>Heliconia</i>), and a specimen of the Kou tree.
Growing on the large old Monkeypod trees that shade the motor
turn-around are examples of the curious Staghorn fern.</p>
<h3>DRIVING FROM WAIKIKI TO TOWN</h3>
<p>The ride from Waikiki to the center of Honolulu provides
an opportunity to see many more trees and flowers. If you go
by the Ala Moana, you pass by Moana Park bordering the shore.
It holds a building, with a large inclosed court, where the Flower
Shows usually take place, and where the Park Board has its office.</p>
<p>If you go by way of Kalakaua avenue and King street, you
will be interested in knowing that the line of trees growing in
the parkway down the middle of Kalakaua for some blocks before
reaching King, are Mahogany trees. At the corner of King and
Keeaumoku is a park-like square with some fine, very old trees,
including some of the Kapok, (<i>Ceiba pentandra</i>) which produces
the kapok floss of commerce. This has huge surface roots, almost
like flying buttresses. The building in this square is the office of
the Territorial Board of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>
<p>A few blocks farther down King street is Thomas Square.
In peace times you can watch the fountain in the center of this
park as you sit under the shade of the four giant Banyans. There
are specimens of the false Wili-wili here, which scatter their red
seeds on the ground in early spring. Facing Thomas Square on
the makai side is the private estate of the Wards known as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Old Plantation, closed to the public. On the other is the Honolulu
Academy of Arts, which is open to the public.</p>
<p>The Academy has two delightful court gardens in the building,
one an Oriental, Chinesque garden, the other a Persian courtyard.
At the back are a series of small formal gardens. There
are always unusual flower arrangements in the Academy building.</p>
<p>Near the center of Honolulu is Iolani Palace, former home
of royalty and now the capitol of the Territory. In the park
around this building are many fine old trees and some interesting
shrubs.</p>
<p>A short distance from the palace, up Punchbowl street, stands
the Queen&rsquo;s Hospital. Years ago some unusual trees were planted
in its grounds, including the Bombax. There is a good example
of the curious Bottle tree or Baobab, (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>), near
the entrance by the Emergency hospital. You can recognize it
by its trunk, which quickly tapers from about five feet in diameter
to hardly more than one foot, as various limbs branch off.</p>
<p>If you go straight out King street, past Fort Shafter, you
will come to Moanalua Gardens, a park-like area at the foot of
the hill. This is a private estate belonging to the Damon family,
but the public is invited to visit it. There is a pond with tropical
water lilies and some extremely large trees. There are also greenhouses
filled with Orchids and Anthuriums which visitors are
sometimes invited to enter.</p>
<h3>NUUANU AVENUE</h3>
<p>A ride out Nuuanu avenue, will reveal a wealth of trees and
flowers. On the left hand side, shortly before reaching School
street, you come to Foster Park. This old estate is now a public
park, presented by Mrs. Mary Foster, but originally it was the
garden of Dr. William Hillebrand. He was an early botanist and
lover of flowers, who imported many new things into the islands
and planted them here. The size of some of his old trees is now
tremendously impressive. Besides this, the city has collected here
many unusual plants. It also maintains a greenhouse in which
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
visitors can see Orchids in bloom and many other unusual, exotic
plants.</p>
<p>Farther out, Nuuanu avenue is bordered by the fine homes
of some of Honolulu&rsquo;s well-to-do citizens. From the road you
can catch many glimpses of charming gardens. Farther up
Nuuanu valley you run into a wild, natural growth. Here you
can find Koa trees, yellow Gingers and green Tis.</p>
<h3>MANOA VALLEY</h3>
<p>Another interesting ride is through Manoa Valley, where
there are many more homes and gardens. This takes you past
the campus of Punahou school which holds a large number of
interesting trees. Along its lower wall is the famous hedge of
Night Blooming Cereus. These flowers have their blossoming
period in July, August, and September.</p>
<p>If you follow Manoa Road, you will come to Waioli Tea
Room, run by the Salvation Army Girls&rsquo; Home. In the garden
there is a real Hawaiian grass house.</p>
<p>Returning down Oahu Avenue you come to a small square,
called Kamanele Park, which holds an unusual Rainbow Shower
tree. A turn to the left here will take you into the grounds of
Mid-Pacific School; at the back is the nursery of the Mid-Pacific
Horticultural Establishment to which visitors are welcome.</p>
<p>A short distance beyond Kamanele Park is the campus of the
University of Hawaii. This holds many unusual plants and trees,
including the famous Sausage tree (<i>Kigelia pinnata</i>). It grows in
the lower corner, across from the fountain.</p>
<h3>DIAMOND HEAD AND KAHALA</h3>
<p>Still another interesting drive is to go toward Diamond Head
from Waikiki, passing through Kapiolani Park, with its row of
Ironwood trees (<i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>), like mainland evergreens.
The road around Diamond Head passes many more fine
gardens, and farther on you come to the residential area known
as Kahala.</p>

<br />HAWAII&rsquo;S OWN FLOWER&mdash;THE HIBISCUS</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i08.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="196" height="200" />
</div>
<p>What is that flower seen everywhere, you may ask, the one
with five, stiff, papery petals, and a column rising in
the center? Such blossoms are seen tumbling in cascades
of pink from small trees, spangling hedges with red
polka dots and decorating green shrubs in an artificial way, looking
like something designed for an old-fashioned stage set.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is Hibiscus, Hawaii&rsquo;s own flower,
and the outstanding flower of all the South Seas. You will see
these blossoms worn in the hair of Hawaiian women, or tucked
over the ear of Samoan men when they dance the native <i>siva-siva</i>.
You will find them strewn down the length of leaf-covered tables
prepared for a native feast or laid out in colorful exhibition on
counters of staid Island banking houses. You may run into them
formed into huge fountaining bouquets, the flower heads fastened
to long, artificial stems, or, at shows and entertainments, you
may see them covering walls and other objects solidly.</p>
<p>All these uses and more are possible because the Hibiscus
possesses the unique trait of not wilting for a day after it is picked.
These flowers open at dawn and live but a single day. Whether they
be left on the shrub, picked and put in water, or laid out dry on
a table top, they remain fresh and crisp until nightfall, when they
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
suddenly close. Fresh buds open every day, so the Hibiscus is
always in bloom.</p>
<p>Individual Hibiscus flowers follow a plan of five, with five
petals, five stigmas, five lobes to the calyx and the like. The stigma
is branched into five parts and is usually a bright crystalline red,
like a bit of coral at the top of the central column. Stamens grow
on the sides of this column, yellowing it with their pollen. This
central column is like the one seen in hollyhocks, a flower which
is a relative of the Hibiscus. Usually it is stiffly upright, but sometimes
it sweeps outward in a graceful curve. When this is the case
it is good indication that the flower is a hybrid and had in
its ancestry the Coral Hibiscus, which has a very long pendulous
column.</p>
<p>Hibiscus also form double flowers, the pink ones sometimes
suggesting old fashioned cabbage roses or peonies. They are formed
when the stamens are modified into petals. Both single and double
flowers appear in all hues but blue. Color tones vary from clear
white through palest pink and yellow to glowing scarlet, orange
and gold, deepening to richer tones and dark crimson. In recent
years hybrids have been produced which bring several hues into a
single flower, one with a red center, for instance, may have yellow
petals bordered in pink. Some of these polychromes are more interesting
than attractive. The size and shape of the flowers vary
also. Average diameter of a blossom may be five or six inches but
some are dwarfs of an inch, while selection has produced some a
foot across. These large ones seem even more artificial than most
of the Hibiscus, almost requiring to be touched before their reality
is established.</p>
<p>The Hibiscus shrub is rather undistinguished in appearance,
growing sometimes into a tall tree twenty feet high, but usually
nearer eight or ten. The leaves are opposite, roundly pointed and
often slightly scalloped.</p>
<p>The Hibiscus is the floral emblem of the Territory of Hawaii.
It was so decided in 1923 by a joint resolution of the Legislature
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
which designated it as &ldquo;a beautiful, indigenous blossom which
grows luxuriously on all the islands, appearing to be most generally
representative, no other flower having so great a variety of
color or form, or such continuous blooming.&rdquo; Botanists point out
that in making this statement the legislature conveniently overlooked
the 150 or so species of Hibiscus which are not native of
Hawaii, in favor of the six or seven which are. Hawaiians called
the native blossoms &ldquo;Kokio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two species of white Hibiscus native to Hawaii,
the commonest being <i>Hibiscus arnottianus Gray</i>. It is found
on Oahu and Molokai. During long periods of time this species
grew in isolated areas in the islands until it developed varieties
which appear to be quite different from each other. These are
known by such names as the Tantalus White, the Waianae White,
the Punaluu White and so on. Another native white Hibiscus is
<i>H. Waimeae</i> called the Kauai White, (which may, however, be
only a form of the other.) These two are the only ones of all the
Hibiscus which are fragrant, having a faint, delicate scent. This
characteristic has sometimes been transmitted to its descendents,
so scented hybrids will occasionally be found. These native whites
also remain open longer than the single day which most Hibiscus
flowers live, <i>Hibiscus Waimeae</i> sometimes lasting even three
days. Occasionally, therefore, a hybrid will also be found which
stays fresh for several days. Both of these characteristics are sought
by hybridists.</p>
<p>Other native species of Hibiscus are <i>H. kokio</i>, which occurs
in red or coral colors on Hawaii, Oahu, Molokai and Maui. <i>Hibiscus
kahili</i> grows on Kauai in several forms colored red or pink,
although this may be a variation of <i>H. kokio</i>. <i>H. brackenridgei</i>
is a yellow species, sometimes with a purplish center, growing on
Kauai, Oahu, Molokai and Maui, while <i>H. youngianus</i> is pink or
purplish.</p>
<p>One of the best places to see many varieties of Hibiscus is
the garden of the Halekulani Hotel. Mrs. Clifford Kimball has
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
made the flower her hobby for years and achieved remarkable results.</p>
<h3>COMMON RED HIBISCUS. CHINA ROSE
<br /><i>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The species of Hibiscus which seems to have the greatest
number of variants is, botanically, <i>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis</i>, sometimes
called the China Rose. The type flower is scarlet, usually
with a deeper colored throat and about five inches in diameter.
It is the one oftenest seen in hedges, since the shrub serves admirably
for this purpose.</p>
<p>These plants seem to have innumerable variations in color
and shape, the former running in hue from yellow to crimson
and appearing in both single and double forms. In fact, it seems
that most of the plants brought into Hawaii, which were not
themselves hybrids, were forms of rosa-sinensis. Although, most
of these imported forms have usually been classed as variants of
rosa-sinensis, it is now believed that many of them were hybrids.
The remarkable variation which occurs when these forms are
crossed points to a mixed ancestry. (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>)</p>
<h3>CORAL HIBISCUS
<br /><i>Hibiscus schizopetalus Hooker</i></h3>
<p>A species which stands out as markedly different from the
usual Hibiscus is <i>H. schizopetalus</i> which has been given the name
in Hawaii of Coral Hibiscus. This is doubtless because its deeply
cut, turned-back petals suggest branches of red coral. The flower
stem is very slender, so the weight of the head causes it to fall over
and hang down, bell-like. And since the central column of this
flower is extremely long and slender it sways far beneath the flower,
giving an effect of peculiar grace. This plant has leaves that
are small and fine. It is tall and slender, almost vine-like, so that
it has been used to make arbors. The Coral Hibiscus has been a
parent of many island hybrids, imparting to them its grace, its
lengthened column and its frilled petals. (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h3>HAWAIIAN INTEREST IN HIBISCUS</h3>
<p>While the Hawaiians had always loved their flower and the
Common Red seems to have been brought in at an early date,
probably direct from China, real interest in Hibiscus culture
began about the turn of the century. Around 1902, Walter M.
Giffard began crossing different strains and getting some of the
spectacular results for which this plant is noted. Interest grew
and as Island people traveled, they often sent or brought home
new varieties. One of the persons who became interested in the
plant was Gerrit Wilder, who seems to have held the first Hibiscus
show. This was in 1914, and he was able then to exhibit some
400 different varieties. In the years following, interest was very
widespread and many people made crosses, until there were literally
thousands of different forms and colors.</p>
<h3>HYBRIDS</h3>
<p>Crossing is very easy. The pollen of one flower is dabbled
on the pistil of another, after its own pollen has been removed.
Precautions are taken to keep the bees from stepping into the experiment,
by protecting the crossed flower with a bag. The seeds
ripen in a month or so and when planted may be expected to
blossom in about a year.</p>
<p>The outcome is a grab bag of mixed and unexpected characteristics.
By selection and care, some hybrids have been produced
that are amazing. New shades and tints come into being,
and mixtures of colors. Doubles become larger and curlier. No
one knows how many thousands of these hybrids have been produced
in Hawaii. Some of them are fairly well established and
widespread by propagation through cuttings; others never existed
in more than one plant. The only color no one has ever produced
is blue. It is the hope of all hybridists.</p>
<h3>WATERFALL OR BUTTERFLY HIBISCUS</h3>
<p>One of the most conspicuous of the hybrids because of its
prolific blooming is that sometimes called the Butterfly or Waterfall
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Hibiscus from its graceful form. This is believed to be a
cross between the Native White and Coral. The plant often
grows into a small tree and is usually a mass of pink flowers.
As a rule, it is the only one of all the Hibiscus plants that carries
enough color to be outstandingly conspicuous in the garden. On
others, the flowers are scattered. (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>)</p>
<h3>YELLOW HIBISCUS</h3>
<p>Among the most beautiful and sought after Hibiscus are
those with yellow or orange blossoms. The range of tone is wide,
the colors appearing from palest lemon to rich yellow, gold and
brilliant orange. The yellow flowering plants are usually rather
small and carry only a few blossoms at a time. (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>)</p>
<h3>ROSE OF SHARON. ALTHEA
<br /><i>Hibiscus syriacus, Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>A close relative of the true Hibiscus is the lavender or white
Althea or Rose of Sharon. The central column is white and the
center of the flower usually dark red. It is a native of Syria and
the Holy Land. (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>)</p>
<h3>TURK&rsquo;S CAP
<br /><i>Malvaviscus arboreus Cavanilles</i></h3>
<p>Another close relative of the true Hibiscus is the little red
Turk&rsquo;s Cap. This looks like a small Hibiscus flower which has
not opened. It never does open widely, but sometimes the number
of the half furled flowers is so great the shrub appears quite red
from them. (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>)</p>
<p>Other relatives of the Hibiscus are the Hau tree (<i>Hibiscus
tiliaceus</i>) and the changeable mallow, (<i>Hibiscus mutabilis</i>) not
to mention the Okra and Roselle among edible plants.</p>

<img src="images/i09.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="198" height="200" />
</div>
<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s most impressive floral displays are the flowering
trees which line the streets and fill the gardens. They
rival, in the masses of their flowers, the fruit trees of
the mainland, but they possess colorings of tropical brilliance
which have no rivals outside of warm countries. Moreover,
instead of blooming for a few brief days, or at most, weeks, these
trees continue in bloom for months at a time. Some of them never
cease. About the middle of June, there is a period when the display
is at its best. This is when all the shower trees are out, the
early ones still lingering, the later ones coming on, and when the
red of the Poinciana, and the blue of the Jacaranda, add their hues
to the galaxy of yellows and pinks. At this time, too, the Plumerias
bring white and rose to the scene. Midwinter finds most of these
gone, but the African Tulip flowers are then a fiery crown on
many trees and some trees, like the canary colored Be-still, continue
their flowering all the year round.</p>
<h3>GOLD TREE. SUNSHINE TREE
<br /><i>Tabebuia donnell-smithi Rose</i></h3>
<p>One of the very special events in Honolulu&rsquo;s floral calendar
is the blooming of the Gold or Sunshine tree which grows on School
Street, near Nuuanu. The time of year at which this takes place
is highly uncertain, being sometimes in midwinter, again late in
the spring. Certain other specimens of the tree are just as erratic,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and none seems to have any relation to another, so that if the
flowering period of one is missed, another may be found in bloom.</p>
<p>When not in bloom the Gold tree is rather ungainly in appearance,
its smooth, slender, light grey trunk lifting the branches
high in the air far beyond reach. But when the flowers suddenly
appear on the bare branches, it seems like the touch of Midas, for
they are shining masses of the purest gold, or like crystallized sunshine.
The breathtaking color is intensified by the necessity of
looking up at them against the vivid blue of a spring sky.</p>
<p>The tree is a member of the Bignonia family, and individual
flowers are of typical Bignonia form, a slightly irregular tube with
five lobes, irregularly margined. The leaves which appear after
the flowers fall are, on older specimens, of compound form made
up of opposite leaflets. On young trees the leaflets radiate from
a common center.</p>
<p>The chief specimen of this tree grows in the Foster Gardens,
now a public park, but originally the home of Dr. William Hillebrand,
who must have planted it along with the many other
novelties which he introduced. A second tree now grows across
School street in a small nursery garden and a fine specimen is
found in Moanalua gardens. Still another grows in the school
grounds across from the Nuuanu YMCA.</p>
<p>It is a native of tropical America. (<a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>)</p>
<h3>ROYAL POINCIANA. FLAMBOYANT
<br /><i>Poinciana regia Bojer</i></h3>
<p>Of all Hawaii&rsquo;s flowering trees, the Royal Poinciana is easily
the most stunning and conspicuous for sheer color and brightness.
A solid mass of red, it is, nevertheless, not merely gaudy, but one
of the most graceful and picturesque of trees, a flat umbrella of
color in small specimens, or composing into long sweeping curves
in larger ones. It suggests the massive regalia of some magnificent
Oriental potentate. The color is most dramatic if viewed against
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
a grey, valley raincloud in the late afternoon, touched by the level
yellow rays of the declining sun.</p>
<p>The tree may become forty feet high, if growing under
favorable conditions, but if the roots are cramped it remains
quaintly dwarfed. Although bare for a short season in winter, the
general flowering season of the Poinciana is long, for some trees
begin to bloom early in spring, while others wait until late summer
to open. June is the month when most of them are in bloom and
the streets are consequently most gorgeous.</p>
<p>Individual Poinciana flowers, which have to be looked for
closely to be distinguished in the masses of bloom at the end of
the branches, have five petals. One of these is white, on the flag-red
trees, or yellow on those tending toward scarlet coloring.
These light touches give a piquant effect to the mass of color.
Long, curved, brown pods hang on the tree for months after
flowers and leaves have gone, and show that this tree is a member
of the legume family.</p>
<p>The flowers usually appear on the bare tree before the new
foliage comes out, but in a short time the leaves appear and for
some weeks the green and red colorings remain together. The
leaves are fernlike, bipinnate in form, with very small leaflets.
Even when the flowers have fallen to form a carpet of red underneath
the green tree, it is graceful and attractive.</p>
<p>It is a native of the island of Madagascar and was named
for de Poinci, a governor of the Antilles in the 17th century. The
French have given it another name, Flamboyant, by which it is
widely known all over the tropical world and one which is particularly
appropriate.</p>
<p>No visitor to Hawaii can miss the Poinciana, but the row
that grows along Wilder avenue is perhaps the most effective,
although individual large trees elsewhere may be more impressive
for size and form. (<a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h3>POTATO TREE
<br /><i>Solanum macrophyllum Dunal</i></h3>
<p>The nightshade family, to which the potato belongs, is one
of the most widespread of botanical groups. It contains however,
but few trees. One of these is usually called the Potato tree,
because its flower is similar in form to that of the common potato.
It grows in Hawaii, but is not common although it grows in
some gardens and in the Mid-Pacific Horticultural Establishment.
While similar in form to the ordinary potato blossom, the flower
of the Potato tree is comparatively large, being about two inches
across. It has five joined segments which give it almost a pentagonal
outline. The color is a rich purple-blue when it first
opens, but this fades to a pale blue and then almost white. In
the center is a golden yellow column made of the thick anthers.</p>
<p>The tree grows very rapidly. Its leaves are large, about a
foot long, and irregularly lobed. They carry a few sharp thorns
along the back of the midrib. The plant is a native of Mexico.
(<a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>)</p>
<h3>TIGER&rsquo;S CLAW. CORAL TREE. INDIAN WILI-WILI
<br /><i>Erythrina indica Lamarck</i></h3>
<p>Tall trees, bursting into pointed red blossoms in midwinter
and early spring, are appropriately called Tiger&rsquo;s claw or Coral
trees. The flowers are a deep, rich, red, very striking on the bare
trees at this season. They grow in long clusters which radiate
horizontally on woody stems from the ends of the branches.
Individual flowers break out of the split side of a pointed calyx.
Fundamentally of the pea-type, these flowers have one petal much
larger than the others, the general effect being that of a pointed
claw or feline toe-nail.</p>
<p>The leaves, which appear soon after the flowers, are made
up of three triangular leaflets. The pod is black and contains
dark red seeds. The branches are thorny.</p>
<p>This tree is a native of tropical Asia and a member of the
legume family. There is a fine specimen growing in the grounds
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
of Iolani Palace which blooms in January or February. Others
grow on Punchbowl street near Beretania, and in the grounds of
the Central Intermediate School.</p>
<p>A closely related tree, which is native to the Hawaiian islands,
is called the Wili-wili by the native people. Botanically it is
<i>Erythrina monosperma</i>. It grows in dry places on the islands
where it is conspicuous for its pale red, orange or yellowish flowers,
similar in form to the Indian Tiger&rsquo;s claw. The bright red seeds
of this Wili-wili were made into leis by the Hawaiians, but nowadays
most of the red seed-leis are made from the <i>Adenanthera
pavonina</i>, known as false Wili-wili. Adenanthera trees, which
have unusual, curling pods filled with the bright red seeds, grow
in Thomas Square where the seeds may be picked up in the Spring.</p>
<p>The wood of the Hawaiian Wili-wili is very light, and so
was used for making the outrigger log of canoes. (<a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>)</p>
<h3>PLUMERIA. GRAVEYARD FLOWER. FRANGIPANI
<br /><i>Plumeria acutifolia Poiret</i></h3>
<p>One of the most popular of Hawaiian flower leis is made
up of the thick, waxy flowers of the Plumeria. They are particularly
successful for this purpose because they remain fresh for
a long time and have a fine fragrance. The common name in
Hawaii, Plumeria, or, as the lei-women say, Pumeli, is derived
from that of Plumier the French botanist, but a mistake was made
in spelling it so the genus is now properly designated as <i>Plumeria</i>,
not <i>Plumiera</i>. Although this tree is a native of tropical America,
it grows in India and in the temple gardens of Ceylon, where it
is known by the romantic name of Frangipani. In Honolulu it
is extensively planted in cemeteries, from which it is known as
the Graveyard flower.</p>
<p>The flower varies from almost white to yellow, with yellow
centers. Another species with rich, cerise, colored flowers is the
<i>Plumeria rubra</i>. These two have crossed and produced a wide
range of flowers with pink or peach colorings. One hybrid, of
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
particularly striking apricot color was produced by Gerrit Wilder.
A specimen may be seen on Manoa Road near the top of Punahou
hill.</p>
<p>The Plumeria tree has a few stiff, blunt branches. At their
tips, the clusters of flowers appear in early spring, when the tree
is still bare, creating a highly picturesque effect. A little later
the foliage appears and the tree continues to bloom the rest of
the year. The flowers have five, waxy petals joining in a short
tube. The leaves, which also cluster toward the tips of the
branches, are very long and pointed at each end, hence the name
acutifolia. When cut, the stems exude a milky juice.</p>
<p>This tree is a member of the Periwinkle family.</p>
<h3>BE-STILL. YELLOW OLEANDER
<br /><i>Thevetia nereifolia Jussieu</i></h3>
<p>A small tree, holding a scattering of trumpet-shaped, yellow
flowers and marked by shimmering, narrow, light green leaves,
is popularly called the Be-still tree. There seems to be no reason
for this name, unless it is that the slender leaves are never still
and the name is a sort of invocation. The flowers are a clear,
satiny, yellow, with a delightful fragrance. They grow here and
there all over the tree, and at all times of the year. A less common
variety has pale, orange-colored flowers. The fruit is a nut which
is poisonous. Green at first it turns brown, then black.</p>
<p>The tree never becomes very large, twenty feet being about
its maximum height. It always has a fresh look, even when growing
in dry places, due to the light color of the leaves. The slender
foliage suggests that of the Oleander (Nerium), accounting for
its specific name of <i>nereifolia</i>, and this association also accounts
for the common name of Yellow Oleander, which, however, is
entirely wrong.</p>
<p>The tree is a member of the Periwinkle family and a native
of tropical America. (<a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h3>AFRICAN TULIP TREE
<br /><i>Spathodea campanulata Beauvois</i></h3>
<p>Large, fiery red flowers, like cups of molten metal, crown
the high branches of the African tulip tree. This tree differs from
many of the flowering trees in Hawaii by producing its flowers
all the year round. There is a season in midwinter when they
seem to be brightest and most numerous, but this may be due
merely to lack of competition.</p>
<p>Individual flowers suggest a lopsided cup, with five irregular,
frilled lobes. The edges of the corolla are a vivid yellow, and
the inside of the cup is yellowish also, with red streaks. The
flowers grow in circular masses of closely crowded buds, a few
developing at a time, so that the tree seems to be ever-blooming.
The flowers grow out of a spathe-like calyx from which is derived
the generic name of <i>Spathodea</i>. They are followed by boat-shaped
pods, some two feet long, which split open and spill out masses
of shining, flaky, winged seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are large and compound in structure, made up
of three or four pairs, and an end leaflet. The leaves are dark
green in color, leathery and with conspicuous veining.</p>
<p>The tree is a member of the Bignonia family and a native
of tropical Africa. Specimens grow in Kamanele Park, Manoa.
(<a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>)</p>
<h3>GOLDEN SHOWER TREE
<br /><i>Cassia fistula Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Immense pendant clusters of large, yellow blossoms, hanging
in grapelike bunches among the leaves explain the popular name
of the Golden Shower tree. Although the foliage does not fall,
the yellow blooms sometimes cover the tree so completely they
overwhelm the leaves and make it look as if this tree were the
only thing in the landscape which is standing in sunshine, all else
being shadowed.</p>
<p>Leaves are very large and compound in structure, each
leaflet being two to six inches long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The bright, golden, yellow flowers have five petals, clearly
veined. Like all the shower trees, which belong to the Pea family,
the yellow flowers are built on the general plan of a pea blossom,
but the five petals are very nearly of the same size and shape.
From the center of the flower project the long curving pistil and
some stamens. This pistil develops into a straight, cylindrical,
black pod, sometimes three feet in length. It has given the name
of Pudding-pipe to the tree in India. This long &ldquo;pipe&rdquo; is the
Cassia pod of commerce, a cathartic being made out of its sticky
brown pulp. The tree is a native of tropical Asia.</p>
<p>Golden Shower trees line both sides of Pensacola street between
Lunalilo and Wilder avenues. They are at their best in
June and July. (<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>)</p>
<h3>PINK AND WHITE SHOWER TREE
<br /><i>Cassia javanica Linnaeus</i>
<br />(<i>Cassia nodosa Hamilton</i>)<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></h3>
<p>Great feathery masses of unevenly tinted, pink flowers
cover this small tree, suggesting in their luxuriance and variable
coloring the apple blossoms of the temperate zone. The flowers
grow on short branchlets, in what seem to be tufts of reddish
stems, the tufts growing out of the main branches so close together
these branches are completely enwrapped. The splendid
effect of such inflorescence makes the Pink and White Shower
tree one of the most important in Hawaii&rsquo;s annual procession of
blossoms. The tree is deciduous and flowers often precede the
leaves, but these shortly appear, adding contrast to the total effect,
with their fresh green. The leaves are of feather form with
many pairs of rounded, medium sized, leaflets.</p>
<p>Each flower is made up of five petals, from the center of
which grows a tuft of stamens. The calyx and stem is dark red.
Each petal is palest pink or white, with deeper pink veinings,
giving the name of Pink and White shower. Eventually, too, the
pale pink fades adding to the variegated effect. The tree remains
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
in bloom for months, with June as its peak. It never becomes
very large and is often quaintly irregular in form. Long,
cylindrical, brown, seed pods hang on when flowers and leaves
have fallen. It is a native of tropical Asia.</p>
<p>This tree is grown widely as a street tree in Honolulu, Piikoi
street between Wilder and Lunalilo being a good place to see it.
There are, also, some fine specimens along Nuuanu avenue.
(<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>)</p>
<h3>ORCHID TREE
<br /><i>Bauhinia variegata Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Exquisite lavender or white orchids, as beautiful as Cattleyas,
seem to grow on the small Orchid tree. It is not, however,
related to the real orchids, but is a member of the legume family.
When covered with pure white flowers the tree is a splendid
sight, but the lavender variety, which blooms more sparsely, shows
more beauty when the individual flowers are examined. They
resemble strikingly the real orchid, with a large main petal marked
with purple, and four crepy side-petals. A bunch of white stamens
grows from the center. The flowers appear in the cooler months,
with spring as the finest season. They are scentless.</p>
<p>The leaves of this Bauhinia, as of others, are peculiarly
shaped being deeply cleft into two rounded lobes, so that they
suggest the wings of a green moth. Insects find the leaves very
succulent, so they are usually full of holes, or completely eaten.</p>
<p>The tree is a native of India where its bark is used for tanning
and dyeing, while its leaves and flower buds are used as a
vegetable. (<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>)</p>
<p>A pink-flowering member of the Bauhinia family is called
the St. Thomas tree and is <i>Bauhinia monandra</i>. This has similar
lobed leaves and pink flowers, both being smaller than on the
Orchid tree. The main pink petal is dotted with crimson and
the tree is very gay when in bloom. After the flowers fall it
hangs full of pods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h3>CORAL SHOWER TREE. PINK SHOWER
<br /><i>Cassia grandis Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Earliest of the shower trees to bloom is the one which has
come to be known in Honolulu as the Coral Shower, or sometimes
as the Pink Shower. (But not to be confused with the later-blooming
Pink and White Shower.) The Coral Shower flowers
during March, April and May, its soft rose color and general
appearance somehow suggesting pink coral. In effect this tree is
strikingly like the blossoming cherries with loose upright limbs
covered with pink flowers.</p>
<p>The flower buds are particularly attractive being rounded,
velvety balls of delicate, pinkish lavender. The flowers hang in
short racemes from the branches completely covering them in
good specimens. Like the pink and white they have five petals,
but are smaller and more evenly colored. Stamens and pistils
project from the center. The leaves follow the first blossoms
closely, the new foliage being pinkish. Leaves are pinnate, with
the leaflets rather large. The pods are cylindrical and dark brown.</p>
<p>Unlike the other showers, which come from Asia, this tree
is a native of tropical America.</p>
<p>Liholiho street, between Wilder and Lunalilo is bordered
with these trees and a fine specimen stands on Punahou campus.
(<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>)</p>
<h3>RAINBOW SHOWER
<br /><i>Cassia hybrida</i>
<br />(<i>Cassia javanica</i> &times; <i>Cassia fistula</i>)</h3>
<p>It probably was inevitable that sooner or later someone
should try to cross the Golden Shower with one or the other of
the two pinks. Fortunately this first took place some years ago,
so that today the many &ldquo;Rainbow Showers&rdquo; resulting from this
cross may be seen in all their breathtaking loveliness. They are
among the most beautiful of all the flowering island trees, and
no two are alike, unless propagated by grafting. In general, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
inflorescence of these hybrids seems more numerous than on either
of the parents, a result, no doubt, of combining the numerous
flowers of the Pink and White with the spreading growth of the
Golden Shower. At the height of their bloom, some of these
trees appear to be almost solid with great fluffy masses of color.</p>
<p>Hues vary from palest cream and lemon yellow through all
manner of peach and apricot tints to some that are a rosy orange.
Flowers of individual trees often hold two tones, resulting in this
variety of coloring. This is an effect that is enhanced frequently
by the difference between the inside and outside of the petals,
the buds being of a different color from the full blown flowers.
There is a great difference, also, in the form of individual flowers.</p>
<p>There is considerable variation in the blooming period, but
on the whole the Rainbow Shower trees come out later than the
others, with July and August as the months of greatest bloom.
They may be seen on Farrington street between Wilder and
Beretania, and there are some fine individual specimens, one on
Lunalilo street between Pensacola and Kapiolani, another on Makiki
above Nehoa. A fine, clear, yellow flowering tree, sometimes
mistaken for a pure Golden Shower, stands in Kamanele
Park. (<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>)</p>
<h3>YELLOW POINCIANA
<br /><i>Peltophorum inerme Roxburgh</i></h3>
<p>A tree with many upright spikes of small, deep-yellow
flowers, bright against the greenery of the fine-cut leaves is called
the Yellow Poinciana, because it was once classed as a Poinciana.
At the same time it is in bloom, it hangs full of reddish-brown
pods which are one of its characteristic features. The flowers
appear in the late summer and autumn, although there may be
a second blooming period at some other time of year.</p>
<p>The flower buds are round and covered with brown, velvety
down. This same down also covers the young growth and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
midrib of the leaves. Individual flowers have five crepe petals
of about the same size. The larger, triangular heads of bloom,
are made up of smaller clusters. The reddish brown pods which
follow the flowers remain on the tree for a long time. They are
thin and flat and hold three or four seeds. The leaves are bipinnate,
composed of many small rounded leaflets. There is no
period when the tree is bare.</p>
<p>This tree, a member of the legume family, is a native of
Malaya and the East Indies. It grows widely in Honolulu, with
several fine specimens in the grounds of Iolani Palace. (<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>)</p>
<h3>MONKEYPOD TREE
<br /><i>Samanea saman</i> (<i>Bentham</i>) <i>Merrill</i></h3>
<p>Those huge, wide-spreading trees&mdash;the largest trees in Honolulu&mdash;which
in spring and summer are often covered with a
thin film of pink flowers, are Monkeypod trees. Stately and
massive, with rough, dark bark, the branches of these trees support
a rounded canopy of leaves. It is a single layer thick and
casts a light shade over an immense area of ground. There is a
giant specimen in Moanalua Gardens; others grow in front of
the Library of Hawaii, and traffic passes around another great
tree in the middle of Vineyard street, near Nuuanu.</p>
<p>The flowers are like short tassels made up of tufts of silky,
pink stamens. They grow on short stems in bunches near the
ends of the branches, and cover the tree lightly during the spring
and summer. They are followed by the thick, dark, pods, which
hang on the tree until the following spring. Leaves are compound
in structure, made up of opposite pairs of pointed leaflets which
fold together in the late afternoon. The leaves fall in spring, and,
together with the drift of falling flowers, which comes a little
later, and the hail of old seed pods, give the Monkeypod the name
of being the dirtiest of Hawaii&rsquo;s trees. Owners who never finish
sweeping up under them always remark, however, that the beauty
of the giant tree is worth the trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>This tree is a legume, a native of Central America and the
West Indies, where its native name is <i>zaman</i>, from which its
scientific name is derived. (<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>)</p>
<h3>BOTTLEBRUSH TREE
<br /><i>Callistemon lanceolatus De Candolle</i></h3>
<p>Long, cylindrical spikes of red flowers, very like the round
brushes used to clean test tubes or bottles, have given its common
name to this tree. The effect is created by tufts of red stamens.
In most varieties the flower spikes grow upright, but on some, as
shown on <a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>, they hang in swaying pendants. Their color
is a fine, pinkish red, which contrasts strikingly with the greyish
green of the foliage. The latter is narrow, pointed and fine.</p>
<p>The tree belongs to the Myrtle family and is a native of
Australia. It is not yet very common in Hawaii, but examples
may be seen on the University of Hawaii campus near Dean Hall.
(<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>)</p>
<h3>JACARANDA
<br /><i>Jacaranda ovalifolia R. Brown</i></h3>
<p>Since blue is the rarest color in the flower world, a tree which
is a mass of blue is something that will hardly be overlooked. Yet
the rarity of the blue coloring in the Jacaranda is but little more
important than the beauty of the tree as a whole. It becomes a
large tree, with light grey bark, and is covered with foliage, each
leaf of which is almost as attractive as a fern. These bipinnate
leaves are symmetrical in form with many tiny leaflets. They
usually fall in late winter and early spring, and the tree is bare
for a short time.</p>
<p>The flowers, which appear in large, loose, clusters at the ends
of the branches, are individually shaped like bells, with two lips,
one with two lobes, the other with three. Their color is a soft,
lavender blue. The blossoming period is erratic, varying from
midwinter to early autumn, but on the whole it is most conspicuous
in spring. On individual trees, this blooming period is not
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
very long, but different trees vary as to the season when the
flowers appear, so that one may usually be found in flower. The
blossoms fall in masses, repeating their color on the ground like a
reflection of the tree above.</p>
<p>The seed pods are of curious shape, round and rather flat.
They have been worn as costume jewelry, when lacquered in gay
colors and attached to ribbons.</p>
<p>Jacaranda belongs to the Bignonia family and is a native of
Brazil, where it got its name. A fine specimen grows on Punahou
campus. Others are along Nehoa street, near Makiki, and on
Manoa road at Kamehameha avenue, and also on Makiki Heights
Road. (<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>)</p>
<h3>CHINESE RICE FLOWER. MAI SUI LAN
<br /><i>Aglaia odorata Loureiro</i></h3>
<p>The tiny, round, yellow blossoms of the Chinese Rice flower
tree probably suggest rice to the Chinese, although each floweret
is considerably smaller than a grain of rice. They occur in clusters
of hundreds, near the ends of the branches, each tiny flower a
minute yellow ball which looks like a bud, but never opens wide.
The blooming period is spring and summer.</p>
<p>The tree is rather small, spreading, and very attractive, being
covered closely with glossy leaves of compound form. It is a
member of the China-berry family and a native of China, from
which it was undoubtedly brought directly to Hawaii by some
returning traveler. It is still found growing mostly in the gardens
of Chinese residents. There is a good specimen in the Mid-Pacific
Horticultural Establishment. (<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>)</p>
<h3>WONG LAN
<br /><i>Michelia champaca Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The intense fragrance and heavy, ivory-colored, waxen quality
of the petals, indicates the relationship of the Michelia to the
Magnolia family. Brought to Hawaii by the Chinese, it is still a
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
great favorite with them. Older women wear a blossom in their
hair, like a bit of carved ivory, and men may slip a few buds into
their shirt pocket where the fragrance can be enjoyed.</p>
<p>The pointed buds, about two inches long, grow upright in
leaf axils near the ends of the branches. Each is encased in a
&ldquo;nightcap&rdquo; type of calyx, which slips off as the flower opens.
The narrow waxen petals are numerous and grow around the
greenish pistil. The flowers are rather inconspicuous but easily
found by the scent, which is heavy, sweet and rather musky.</p>
<p>The tree grows upright and never attains great size. Its
leaves are glossy, leathery, rather pointed and about eight inches
in length. (<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>)</p>
<h3>BOMBAX
<br /><i>Bombax ellipticum Humboldt, Bonpland and Kunth</i></h3>
<p>A Bombax tree growing in the Queen&rsquo;s Hospital grounds
presents such a striking appearance when blooming that it has
become almost as well known as the Gold tree on School street.
Unlike the latter, however, which blooms at erratic times, the
Bombax can be depended on to put out its blossoms in March
and April. They appear on the bare tree, a few at a time, suggesting
a bunch of pink egret plumes.</p>
<p>The bud, growing upright on the bare branch, is like a
stubby cigar, rising from the calyx which is like the cup of an
acorn. The bud splits into five parts, which peel backward like
a banana, and curl into a spiral. These are the petals, purplish
brown outside, silky white within. The conspicuous part of the
flower is the great pompon of pink stamens, an exploding rocket
of color. The stamens are about five inches long.</p>
<p>Except when in bloom the tree is inconspicuous. Its foliage
is made up of five radiating leaflets. The tree is a native of South
America and a member of the Bombax family.</p>
<p>The species is said to produce pods in which the seeds are
embedded in a cotton wool. It is, indeed, closely related to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Kapok tree which produces the kapok of commerce. (For an
example of this tree, <i>Ceiba pentandra</i>, see the Foster gardens.)
But in Honolulu the single specimen of Bombax has never produced
seeds nor has it been propagated by other means, so that
the tree in Queen&rsquo;s Hospital grounds has no rivals in interest
although others are known to be growing in the Islands. (<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>)</p>

<br />NATIVE TREES</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i10.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="199" height="200" />
</div>
<p>Long before the first human being landed on Hawaii,
these islands were covered with a thick growth of trees,
shrubs and smaller plants. Land which first rose above
the surface of the ocean as hot lava, or as coral, slowly
deposited on undersea volcanic rocks, gradually became covered
with plant life. It was brought ashore by ocean currents, by birds
and by the wind. Among the first plants, doubtless, was the
coconut. The huge nuts of this tree, covered with their tough,
thick husks, can float on the ocean for months, and after finally
washing ashore will take root and grow. The roots are tolerant
of brackish water so that they can become established near salt
water lagoons.</p>
<p>In spite of what we know of the way in which such isolated
bits of land as Hawaii became covered with plants, it remains a
constant wonder that so many different ones arrived here without
the help of men. For Hawaii has a very rich native flora
that has been of great interest to botanists. Many of the plants
found growing here are common to all the South Sea islands.
Others have so changed, through mutation and self-selection, that
totally new species have been created, unique to Hawaii. Trees
are among the finest of these native plants, some of them attaining
huge size. A few of those most often seen, are illustrated and
described here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3>HAU
<br /><i>Hibiscus tiliaceus Linneaus</i></h3>
<p>One of the strangest of the native trees is the Hau (pronounced
&ldquo;how&rdquo;). It is found on all the South Sea islands and is,
indeed, cosmopolitan in the tropics everywhere. This tree is often
grown on Hawaiian beaches to cast shade on the sand by training
it over an arbor. It is normally a creeping or procumbent
tree, spreading along the ground. Its long, sinuous branches
interlock, if not trained, and eventually form jungles too thick
to penetrate except by cutting. When this mass of branches is
lifted off the ground, by being trained over some strong support,
they form a thick green roof which keeps out light showers. These
arbors are called <i>Hau lanais</i> in Hawaii. They have been made
at many places along Waikiki beach, one of the best being on the
seaward side of the Halekulani hotel. Here the central tree is
very old, its trunk, gnarled and twisted and several feet through,
creating an unusually impressive specimen.</p>
<p>The Hau is a true Hibiscus, its flowers having the typical
form with a central column rising from the center of the five
petals. When the petals unfold they are a bright yellow color,
usually with a dark spot at the base. As they grow older during
the day they turn to an apricot color and when they finally fall,
they are a deep red. The leaves are heart-shaped, green and
leathery above, whitish and silky with hairs, beneath.</p>
<p>The bent branches of the Hau furnish the crooked sticks
used to attach the outrigger log to native canoes. And as
might be expected of such a unique tree, many legends cluster
around it. (<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>)</p>
<h3>HALA. LAUHALA. PUHALA. SCREWPINE
<br /><i>Pandanus odoratissimus Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Another plant of strange and curious appearance is the Hala,
or Screwpine. It might be taken at first sight for a palm, since
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
its leaves have the tough, fibrous quality of palm leaves. Actually
it belongs to a family which takes its name from this genus, the
Pandanaceae. It grows all over the South Seas and the East Indies,
and India.</p>
<p>The descriptive name of Screwpine comes from the way
in which the long, narrow, spiny-edged leaves grow out of the
branches, in winding whorls. On young specimens they often
create curious spirals. On older trees the leaves have a tendency
to form tufts at the ends of the branches. These branches divide
in pairs, the tree forming a series of ascending Y&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The most striking feature of this tree is the way in which
it sometimes puts out aerial roots to support the main trunk. These
roots grow out and downward, as stiff and straight as a stilt,
propping up the tree in what seems an entirely artificial manner.
Such roots seem to appear only when the plant needs them, when
it is old and heavy or when the soil is moist and loose and does
not offer a firm hold.</p>
<p>Male and female flowers grow on different Hala trees. The
male flowers, called <i>Hinano Hala</i>, appear as a long, white, pendulous
cluster of blossoms, the showy portion being the bracts.
They have many stamens and the flower is extremely fragrant.
In Hawaii these male flowers are not so frequently seen as the
female. The latter appear as a solid, round ball at the ends of the
branches, looking a good deal like the fruit of a pineapple, (see
<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>). It is a standard joke to point these out to tourists as
proof that pineapples grow on trees.</p>
<p>The Hala fruit is a drupe, the various sections colored orange
and very smooth and shining. When separated, the sweet scented
fleshy part is strung into leis by the Hawaiians, making one of
the most curious of these native garlands.</p>
<p>The long, fibrous leaves are called Lauhala and are split and
woven into many products. Lauhala floor mats are frequently
seen, while finer work is done in making purses, hats and fans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>A relative of the Hala tree is a vine (<i>Freycinetia arnottii</i>),
called <i>Ie-ie</i> in Hawaiian. Its male flowers are a bright scarlet,
and form a conspicuous sight in the cooler mountain forests where
it grows wild.</p>
<h3>OHIA LEHUA
<br /><i>Metrosideros polymorpha Gaudichaud</i></h3>
<p>The favorite flower of old Hawaiian song and legend is the
<i>Ohia Lehua</i>. It is not found commonly at the warm levels of
Honolulu, and never becomes more than a shrub there, but it
may be seen in upper Nuuanu valley and on Tantalus. This
plant reaches its greatest perfection, as a magnificent tree, often
a hundred feet high, at the cool level of the volcano on the Big
Island of Hawaii. The Lehua blossom is the special flower of
that island.</p>
<p>The flowers appear as bright red pompons of stamens; sometimes
however, they are white, pink or yellow, for the plant is
extremely varied. The leaves are small and often reddish when
young.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian people believe that this beautiful red flower
is sacred to Pele, the goddess of the volcano. If a flower is picked
she may show her anger by sending rain, but if an offering of a
flower is first made to her, then others may be taken safely. The
flowers are made into leis&mdash;the Sweet Lei-Lehua of the song&mdash;which
are highly regarded.</p>
<p>The Ohia wood is dark, hard and very beautiful, much used
for floors and fine carving. The early Hawaiians made images
of their gods from it, as well as spears and other implements.</p>
<p>The Lehua is a member of the Myrtle family and found on
various South Sea islands. (<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>)</p>
<p>Another shrub, (<i>Calliandra haematoma</i>) has been introduced
into Hawaii and is now known as the <i>Haole Lehua</i>, that
is, the foreign Lehua. It has tufts of red flowers, very like those
of the native plant, but they are larger and even more showy
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
than the true Lehua. During the winter and spring, leis are made
of these and are often seen, being casually called Lehua leis.</p>
<h3>KAMANI
<br /><i>Calophyllum inophyllum Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>A tree that grows wild along the seashore is given the name
of <i>Kamani</i> by the Hawaiians. It has large, thick, leathery leaves,
very smooth and shining, and clusters of waxy, white flowers.
These flowers have four white petals and in the center is a mass
of golden stamens surrounding a red pistil. They are fragrant.</p>
<p>The flowers are followed by round, reddish fruits which
contain an oily nut. In other parts of the tropics, especially Fiji
and India, this oil has important uses, but it is not extracted in
Hawaii. The tree belongs to the Mangosteen family and is found
widely through the tropics. The nut may have floated to the
shores of Hawaii or possibly some early Polynesian voyager brought
it in his double canoe.</p>
<p>True Kamani trees grow on the campus of the University
of Hawaii. They may also be seen on a ride around the island,
growing near the beach. (<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>)</p>
<p>A tree called locally False Kamani, is the <i>Terminalia catappa</i>.
Its large leaves and the fact that it, too, grows near the sea probably
caused it to be given this name. The special characteristic
of this tree is the way its large leaves turn red before they fall in
winter. A scattering of these big red leaves on the tree is very
noticeable, and when the whole tree finally turns red it becomes
a conspicuous object. New, shining green leaves shortly follow
the old. A fine example of this tree grows in the grounds of
Iolani Palace.</p>
<h3>KOA
<br /><i>Acacia koa Gray</i></h3>
<p>Like the Ohia, the Koa tree does not grow well at lower
altitudes, but at proper elevations, such as near the volcano, on
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
the Island of Hawaii, it becomes Hawaii&rsquo;s largest and finest tree.
It is, perhaps best known to town dwellers by its wood, known
as Hawaiian mahogany, which has been extensively used in furniture.
In cooler sections of Honolulu, such as Tantalus, and upper
Nuuanu, Koa trees may be found growing. They seldom attain
much size, but are often of very picturesque form.</p>
<p>The most characteristic thing about the Koa is its sickle-shaped
leaf, like those found on many other members of the
Acacia group. It is not a true leaf, however, but the flattened,
grayish-green petiole, or leaf stem, modified to serve as a leaf.
Such a modification is called a phyllode. The true leaves grow
on young trees and sometimes appear on new growth. They are
bipinnate, or fernlike, with many small leaflets. Both true and
modified leaves are shown in <a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>, but no flowers. Koa
flowers are very inconspicuous, being small, creamy balls of
stamens and pistils, like so many of the other Acacia flowers. They
are followed by numerous small, brown pods.</p>
<p>The tall straight trunk of the Koa tree was used by the
early Hawaiians to make canoes. A fine tree growing in the
mountain was selected by the <i>kahuna</i>, or wise man of the village,
and laboriously cut down with stone adzes. Then the whole village
turned out to help drag it to the water&rsquo;s edge. Here it was
hollowed and shaped with stone implements. Finally, it was
colored and the out-rigger attached, the entire process taking
months, perhaps years.</p>
<h3>MILO
<br /><i>Thespesia populnea</i> (<i>L.</i>) <i>Correa</i></h3>
<p>A tree which has heart-shaped leaves, like those of the Hau,
and Hibiscus-shaped flowers, but is of upright, normal form, is
the Milo. The flower is a paler yellow than the Hau blossom,
and has a red spot at the base of the petals. As it fades, it turns
from yellow to a purplish pink. It is followed by a five-parted
green capsule, which turns dark brown and hangs on the tree
a long time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The Milo is a member of the Mallow family and closely
related to the true Hibiscus. Like the Hau, it is at home over a
wide area in the South Seas and the Asiatic tropics. It is found
growing on the beaches and is said to have shaded the grass hut
home at Waikiki of the first King Kamehameha. (<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>)</p>
<h3>KOU
<br /><i>Cordia sebestena Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>A native tree with bright orange colored blossoms is called
<i>Kou</i> by the Hawaiians. Botanically it is <i>Cordia subcordata</i>.
Though found on other South Sea islands, it is now rare in Hawaii,
while a close relative, the <i>Cordia sebestena</i>, is generally called
Kou. This foreign Kou, which has been introduced from tropical
America, is quite similar in general appearance to the native
species. Its flowers are a rich, orange-red, about an inch across.
They are tubular, with six broad lobes, frilled and crepe-like in
texture. Opening in clusters of three or four at a time, they
make a gay showing over the small tree on which they grow. The
leaves are very rough and shaped like a heart. Several trees grow
on Young street between Piikoi and Pensacola streets. (<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>)</p>
<p>The wood of the native Kou was highly prized for making
the wooden bowls from which the Hawaiians ate.</p>
<h3>KUKUI. CANDLENUT TREE
<br /><i>Aleurites moluccana</i> (<i>L.</i>) <i>Willdenow</i></h3>
<p>Conspicuous for its light colored foliage, groves of the Kukui
tree are easily seen on the mountain side, from a long distance.
The trees grow best in sheltered ravines and gullies, so that from
a distance, the shadow of such ravines is usually lightened by the
blotches of greyish green which mean Kukui trees. The trees grow
down to sea level, however, and may be found at many places in
Honolulu, among others in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel garden.</p>
<p>Leaves of the Kukui tree vary greatly. One type has pointed
lobes, another has lobes which have flattened into almost regular
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
form. The leaves are covered with a grayish down, which is
particularly heavy on the under side, giving the tree its light
appearance.</p>
<p>The white flowers are very small with five petals. They
come in soft, massed clusters, male and female flowers growing
separately on the same tree. The male appear on the upper
branches, the female on the lower. They are not very different
in appearance, but the male (illustrated on <a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>) has slightly
broader petals. The Kukui is the special flower of Molokai.</p>
<p>The round green fruit contains a nut which was very useful
to the early Hawaiians. Containing a high percentage of oil, it
was used to make a candle-like torch, by stringing the nuts on
the slender midrib of a coconut leaflet. Sixty or seventy nuts
would burn an entire evening. The nut is also edible, although
purgative in its action especially when not roasted. A pinch of
ground, roasted Kukui nut is always served at luaus.</p>
<p>This tree is a member of the Euphorbia family. It grows
widely over the South Seas.</p>

<br />TROPICAL SHRUBS</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i11.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="201" height="200" />
</div>
<p>Hawaii has a wealth of flowering shrubs, most of them
introduced from other tropical regions to augment the
few which are native. These shrubs make up the larger
portion of island gardens, since many of the annuals
and perennials of the temperate zone do not grow well in a warm
climate. Many of the shrubs have unusual flower forms and
others create spectacular effects with masses of color.</p>
<h3>PAGODA FLOWER
<br /><i>Clerodendron squamatum Vahl</i></h3>
<p>Brilliant scarlet flowers, in large, loose, upright heads, proclaim
the Clerodendron. The blooming period is winter and
spring. Individual flowers are slenderly tubular, widening into
five narrow lobes which turn back against the tube. The stamens
and pistil curve beyond the flower in a small red tuft. Stems of
the flower head are also red and hold this color even when the
green berries turn blue-black.</p>
<p>The shrub grows about ten feet tall. Its large, heart-shaped
leaves are thick and velvety, with wavy margins and prominent
venation. The stems and pedicels are downy, and the latter have
a tendency to turn red as the leaf matures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>This exotic looking shrub comes from South China and
India. It is a member of the Verbena family. Specimens grow
in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel garden and Thomas Square. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>GOLDEN DEWDROP
<br /><i>Duranta repens Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The popular name, Golden Dewdrop well describes the
clusters of small, bright, yellow berries which hang on this shrub
a large part of the year. They are so plentiful they usually cause
the slender, grey-stemmed branches to droop gracefully. They
lend themselves to interesting arrangements. The shrub may
attain ten feet in height. Its small, light-green leaves are pointed
at either end.</p>
<p>The flowers are a delicate, lavender-blue, or white, very
small and formed as minute tubes, with five lobes. They grow
as spreading clusters at the ends of the branches.</p>
<p>This shrub, a member of the Verbena family, is a native of
tropical America. It is grown in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
garden. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>SHRIMP PLANT
<br /><i>Beloperone guttata Brandegee</i>
<br />(<i>Beloperone nemorosa</i>)</h3>
<p>Rosy or yellowish bracts, overlapping with scale-like precision
to form a curving tube, are highly suggestive of the curved
tail of a shrimp and explain the popular name of this plant. The
true flowers appear, one or two at a time, from beneath the
colored bracts, near the tip. They are small, white, tubular, with
purplish dots on the larger of the two lobes.</p>
<p>The plant is herbaceous and sprawling, growing at most to
five feet. Its leaves are slightly rough to the touch, opposite, and
of medium size. It is a native of tropical America and a member
of the Acanthus family. It grows in the garden of the Royal
Hawaiian hotel. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>

<h3>FLOWERING ERANTHEMUM
<br /><i>Pseuderanthemum reticulatum Radlkofer</i></h3>
<p>Conspicuous for its yellowish leaves and small white and
purplish flowers is this Eranthemum. The yellow color appears
extensively on the young leaves and survives on the older ones as
yellow venations, making the plant appear very bright and sunny.
The tubular flowers grow in small spikes, the tubes broadening
into four lobes. These are spotted with purple dots where they
begin to broaden.</p>
<p>The plant grows about six feet high. It belongs to the
Acanthus family and possibly comes from Indo-Malaya or Polynesia.
Specimens may be seen in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel garden.
(<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>VINCA ROSEA. MADAGASCAR PERIWINKLE
<br /><i>Lochnera rosea</i> (<i>L.</i>) <i>Reichenbach</i></h3>
<p>Rosy pink or pure white flowers, on a short, herbaceous
plant which looks like a temperate zone annual, is the Periwinkle.
It is a cousin of the blue myrtle, or periwinkle of the mainland,
but resembles the latter only in the general form of the flowers.
Known elsewhere as Madagascar periwinkle (although not a native
of that island) it is called in Hawaii simply Periwinkle or Vinca.</p>
<p>The flowers are flat, five-petalled and ever-blooming. Some
of the white ones have a cerise eye in the center. The leaves are
greyish, long, narrow, with blunt tips. It is a cosmopolitan in
the tropics and can be found growing on the University of Hawaii
grounds. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>RONDELETIA
<br /><i>Rondeletia odorata Jacquin</i></h3>
<p>Small, round, heads of many bright, red and yellow flowers
mark the Rondeletia. It is a shrub which is not common in
Hawaii but may be found in the Royal Hawaiian and Foster
gardens. The flowers are tubular, with a bright yellow throat
and orange-red lobes. The leaves are opposite and sessile. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
shrub grows to about six feet high. It is a native of Mexico and
a member of the Coffee family. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>STAR JASMINE
<br /><i>Jasminum pubescens Willde</i>
<br />(<i>Jasminum multiflorum</i>)</h3>
<p>The Star Jasmine takes its name from the starry, white
flowers which cover the plant at all seasons. Each has from four
to nine, pointed lobes, radiating from the mouth of the slender
tube. Ordinarily, they are scentless, but a variety with faint
fragrance is now becoming popular. When the flowers fall, they
leave a group of coarsely hairy, green calyxes like small green
pompons. The plant is at first a sprawling shrub, but later
becomes a vine. Its leaves grow in opposite pairs along the length
of the shoots. They are pointed and slightly velvety. This plant
is widely used in Honolulu. It is a native of tropical Asia, and
like all the Jasmines, belongs to the Olive family. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>GALPHIMIA
<br /><i>Thryallis glauca Kuntze</i>
<br />(<i>Galphimia glauca</i>)</h3>
<p>Small, terminal, clusters of bright, yellow, little flowers with
red stamens, characterize the Galphimia shrub. It grows about
five feet high and has small, glossy, opposite leaves. The yellow
flowers bloom most of the year, making the plant popular in
gardens.</p>
<p>The word Galphimia, by which it is popularly known, is
an anagram of Malpighia, the name of the Italian physician for
which the family to which it belongs was named. It is a native
of southern Mexico. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>PLUMBAGO
<br /><i>Plumbago capensis Thunberg</i></h3>
<p>The pale blue flowers of the Plumbago are frequently seen
especially in dry places where the plant thickly covers the ground
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
or grows over walls and trellises, often with a heavy undergrowth
of dead branches below. The flowers have a long tube and five
lobes, and grow in short clusters. Their blue color varies from
a soft azure to palest tints, and there is a pure white variety. The
species with pink blossoms is <i>Plumbago rosea</i>.</p>
<p>The blue flowering plant is a native of South Africa, near
the Cape of Good Hope, as its name indicates. It gives the name
of Plumbago to its family. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>IXORA
<br /><i>Ixora macrothyrsa Teijsmann and Binnendijk</i></h3>
<p>Large, round &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; heads of scarlet bloom make the
Ixora a very conspicuous shrub. Sometimes it seems almost like
a small tree for it can reach fifteen feet in height. The small
individual flowers have four petals growing at the end of a slender
tube that appears to be a red stem. These flowers are sometimes
laboriously strung by the Hawaiians into leis, which become solid
red cylinders, two to three inches in diameter. There are also
plants with pale red or with white flowers, the latter scented.
The shrub has fine, large, glossy foliage suggestive of that of the
Coffee, of which family it is a member. It is a native of Malaya.</p>
<p>There is a tendency in Honolulu to mispronounce the name
as if it were spelled Exoria. (<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>)</p>
<h3>CANDLEBUSH. ACAPULCO
<br /><i>Cassia alata Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Upright stalks of bright yellow flowers, almost cylindrical
in form, explain the popular name of this shrub. When first
opening, the individual flowers are closer together on the stalk
than shown on <a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>, heightening the suggestion of
golden candles growing over the shrub. The flowers are at their
best in winter, although they may be found later. The individual
flowers are pea shaped, as the plant is a member of this family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The leaves are luxuriant, each one from eighteen inches to
two feet long. The leaf is made up of many pairs of large leaflets,
which increase in size from the base to the tip. The plant is
probably a native of tropical America, but is widely grown in
the tropics.</p>
<h3>CORAL PLANT
<br /><i>Russelia juncea Zuccarini</i></h3>
<p>Tiny, tubular red flowers, growing loosely over the drooping
sprays of a graceful bush have again suggested coral and given
the name of Coral plant to this shrub. The sprays may grow to
six feet, with stems and a few leaves of greyish green. Individual
flowers are about an inch long, tubular, and hang loosely on
slender angular stems. The plant is a native of Mexico and belongs
to the Figwort family. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<h3>LIPSTICK PLANT
<br /><i>Bixa orellana Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Seedpods of the lipstick plant are extremely ornamental and
are often used as dried floral material. They are covered with
heavy soft, dark hairs, deep red when fresh and turning to stiff
brown as they dry. The pointed pod splits to reveal rows of
seeds covered with a red powdery material. This red covering
provides the annotto dye of commerce, used among other things
for coloring oleomargarine, butter and cheese. It is not produced
commercially in Hawaii, but the plants are grown for this purpose
in tropical America, where they are native. The name Lipstick
plant was produced locally on the spur of the moment when
a name was needed, based on the way the red material smeared
the skin.</p>
<p>Flowers of this plant, which appear in summer, are pale
orchid pink, the five petals surrounding a central mass of lavender
stamens. The foliage is dark green and prominently veined. The
shrub may attain almost the proportions of a small tree. Specimens
grow in Iolani Palace grounds across from the Library of
Hawaii. The plant is a member of the Bixa family. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3>BRUNFELSIA
<br /><i>Brunfelsia hopeana Bentham</i></h3>
<p>A shrub curiously covered in spring with both blue and
white flowers, superficially suggesting pansies in form, is the
Brunfelsia. The two colorings are due to the fact that the flowers
are a soft lavender blue when they open but fade to almost pure
white before they fall. They have five velvety petals, which are
actually the lobes of a slender tube, and they give off a delicate
fragrance.</p>
<p>The shrub is woody, with light grey bark and sparse dark
green leaves. This species is a native of Brazil. A specimen grows
on Metcalf street near Hunnewell. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<p>Another Brunfelsia grows in Honolulu with white flowers
which turn a deep cream as they grow older. This is <i>B. americana</i>,
a native of tropical America. It is almost scentless by day, but
develops fragrance after dark. Both are members of the nightshade
family.</p>
<h3>COTTON
<br /><i>Gossypium barbadense Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The cotton plant is a cousin of the Hibiscus and in Hawaii
grows to be a tall shrub which is often used in gardens. The
yellow flowers are formed like Hibiscus, but do not open widely.
As they fade, they become tinged with purple, a color change
which suggests the related Hau and Milo blossoms. The seed
case is large, round and pointed and partly covered by three
fringed bracts. When it opens the boll of white cotton, in which
are the seeds, breaks out. This fluff of white fiber remains on
the plant for a long time, suggesting a different kind of blossom.
In Hawaii the local cotton is sometimes gathered and used for
homemade mattresses, but it is inferior in quality.</p>
<p>Cotton leaves are heart-shaped and velvety, due to whitish
hairs which cover them and give a greyish green appearance to
the plant. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h3>ILIMA
<br /><i>Sida fallax Walpers</i></h3>
<p>Another close relative of the Hibiscus is the Ilima, a native
plant which has orange flowers about an inch across, looking like
miniature Hibiscus blooms. The color ranges in tone from light
yellow through orange and buff, to brownish red, but the orange
color is the most popular. Leaves and stems are covered with
whitish hairs creating a velvety effect. The plant grows as a
small shrub, rather straggling in appearance. It is seldom cultivated
except by the lei makers, but is found wild in dry places.
It also grows on other South Sea islands.</p>
<p>Leis made of these thin, silky flowers are the originals of
the often-seen orange paper leis, like paper ropes about an inch
in diameter. The paper leis, which are so artificial looking, are
nevertheless really very much like the flower originals. The true
Ilima lei has the soft texture of flesh, created by great numbers
of the flowers being strung flatly together. In early days such
leis were reserved for royalty and they are still called the royal
lei. The Ilima is the flower of the Island of Oahu. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<h3>THUNBERGIA
<br /><i>Thunbergia erecta T. Anderson</i></h3>
<p>Rich purple-blue flowers with golden throats are Thunbergias,
closely related to the white and blue flowering vines of the
same name. The velvety purple petals are lobes expanding a tube
that is whitish without and bright yellow within. The flowers
grow singly in leaf axils, emerging from a pair of whitish bracts.
The blossoms are thin and delicate and fade almost at once after
being picked.</p>
<p>There is a pure white flowering form with yellow throat.</p>
<p>The plant is an open, rather straggling shrub, about five
feet high. Its slender branches bear small opposite leaves, rather
pointed at either end. It is a native of tropical west Africa and
belongs to the Acanthus family. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h3>MOCK ORANGE
<br /><i>Murraya exotica Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The Mock Orange bears flowers several times a year in
sporadic outbursts which cover the plant with clusters of small
snowy blossoms. At such times the fragrance nearby is so intense
that no one in the vicinity can miss it. The Mock Orange is a
true member of the Citrus family and has the delightful scent
which they all possess. Individual flowers are five petaled, and
waxy, like a very small orange blossom. When these petals fall
they cover the ground with white. The fruit is a small red ball
filled with a large seed. It is not edible, but very bitter.</p>
<p>Between periods of bloom the shrub, which may become a
small tree, remains attractive in its small, glossy, dark green foliage.
Leaves are compound, the leaflets being about two inches
long and pointed. This shrub is a native of tropical Asia and
widely grown. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<h3>JUSTICIA
<br /><i>Odontonema strictum Kuntze</i>
<br />(<i>Justicia carnea</i>)</h3>
<p>The Justicia bears stiff, upright spikes of red flowers, each
one a waxy little cornucopia with five small lobes. The flower
stalk is a mass of buds, of which only a few, up and down its
length, develop at a time giving it a rather ragged and irregular
appearance, but prolonging its blooming season almost indefinitely.
The open flowers fall quickly.</p>
<p>The plant is herbaceous and grows about five feet high.
Its leaves are bright green and glossy, large, pointed, and with
prominent veins. It is a native of tropical America and belongs
to the Acanthus family. (<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>)</p>
<h3>DWARF POINCIANA. PRIDE OF BARBADOES
<br /><i>Caesalpinia pulcherrima</i> (<i>L.</i>) <i>Swartz</i></h3>
<p>Bright clusters of fiery scarlet and yellow flowers growing
on the higher branch tips of a tall shrub or small tree, announce
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
the Dwarf Poinciana. While not a true Poinciana, it is a close relative,
so that its common name is not far amiss. Individual flowers
are smaller, but quite similar in form to those of Royal Poinciana,
with five crepy spreading petals and a colored calyx. The petals are
sometimes margined with yellow which gives added brilliance to
the effect. Very long stamens and pistil project from the center.
Unlike Poinciana, the plant blooms most of the year. Flat seedpods
follow the flowers. There is an all-yellow flowered form.</p>
<p>The leaves are doubly compound, with many small rounded
leaflets along the pinnae. It is a legume, and widely grown in the
tropics. In India it is the sacred flower of Siva. Specimens grow in
the University of Hawaii grounds. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<p>A similar plant with flowers of bright yellow but with conspicuous,
long, red stamens is <i>Caesalpinia gilliesii</i>, sometimes called
Bird of Paradise.</p>
<h3>CHENILLE PLANT
<br /><i>Acalypha hispida Burmann</i></h3>
<p>One of the strangest looking of tropical shrubs bears long,
thin velvety tails of dark red, which well deserve the common name
of Chenille plant, or sometimes, Redhot Cat-tails. The shrub will
attain eight feet and presents a striking appearance with these long,
crimson, flower spikes hanging from among the large green leaves.
The tails are made up of the staminate flowers, which have no
petals; pistillate flowers are inconspicuous. A fine plant grows in
front of Gumps at Waikiki. The shrub is a member of the Euphorbia
family and a native of the East Indies. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<h3>CAPE HONEYSUCKLE
<br /><i>Tecomaria capensis</i> (<i>Lindley</i>) <i>Seemann</i></h3>
<p>The orange red flowers of this shrub have the typical trumpet
form of the Bignonias, to which family it belongs. The slightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
curving tube broadens into five lobes, beyond which extend the
yellow stamens. The flowers appear in small clusters at the
branch ends.</p>
<p>The shrub is sprawling and vinelike, often used as a ground
cover. It may be seen at the University of Hawaii. It has small,
compound leaves notably dark green in color, each leaflet having a
serrated margin. Its specific name, capensis, reveals its native home
to be South Africa.</p>
<h3>CREPE MYRTLE
<br /><i>Lagerstroemia indica Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>In midsummer there is a sudden burst of bright, pink blossoms
in Honolulu, due to the flowering of the Crepe Myrtle. Most of
these plants are shrubs, but sometimes they attain the size of a
small tree. The exceedingly frilled, fringed and crepy petals, five
to a flower, occur in such fluffy masses that individual blossoms
are often hard to distinguish. There is a white variety and some
vary in color to lavender.</p>
<p>Leaves are small, leathery, smooth above, but rough beneath.
The stems are brown. The bark, when the plant attains tree size,
is so smooth that in some Oriental countries, where it is native, it
is called a &ldquo;monkey slide&rdquo; tree. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<p>A large tree in the Foster Garden bears heads of lavender
bloom in summer, making a very striking appearance. This tree
is <i>Lagerstroemia speciosa</i>.</p>
<p>Crepe myrtles belong to the Henna family and are natives
of the Far East.</p>
<h3>CROWN FLOWER. GIANT INDIAN MILKWEED
<br /><i>Calotropis gigantea R. Brown</i></h3>
<p>The Crown Flower derives its name from its oddly shaped
blossoms which rise in clusters at the branch ends. The flowers
are a grayish lavender or a greenish white, the latter being more
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
popular for lei making than the former. Above the five thick,
starlike, greenish petals rises a miniature crown which looks as if
it had been carved from white jade. It is tipped by the stamens
and the five pointed style. These &ldquo;crowns,&rdquo; when stripped from
the flower, are strung into leis which appear like carved beads;
indeed, they have been imitated in carved ivory, perhaps the best
of all the imitation flower leis.</p>
<p>The shrub grows rather tall. It is whitish, the stems and
thick leaves being covered with down. When cut, the stems give
off a milky juice as do other members of the Milkweed family.
This plant is a native of India, where, like the Caesalpinia, it is
sacred to Siva. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<h3>BEACH NAUPAKA
<br /><i>Scaevola frutescens</i> (<i>Miller</i>) <i>Krause</i></h3>
<p>A quaint little flower, which seems to have been torn in
half, since the white petals radiate in only half of a circle, is called
Naupaka-kai by the Hawaiians. It is a native plant, found wild
on the beaches of these islands, and others in the South Seas. It
has been adopted here for seashore planting, since it is resistant
to wind and salt spray. There are other species of Scaevola growing
in Hawaii, some of them preferring a mountain habitat, but
all are characterized by the half blossom. The five petals have
purple streaks. Leaves of the Beach Naupaka are thick and grey-green
because of a velvety down. They become broader toward
the tips than toward the base.</p>
<p>A plant with such an odd flower would be certain to have
had legends created about it. They are several in Hawaii, usually
on the theme of lovers parted, typified by the incomplete blossom.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the Goodenia family. It may be seen
growing along the seawall of the Halekulani hotel or along the
shore lines of the Islands. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h3>PURPLE, OR TRAILING LANTANA
<br /><i>Lantana sellowiana Link and Otto</i></h3>
<p>A low, covering plant, dotted with small clusters of rosy
lavender flowers is the purple Lantana. The flower heads are an
inch or so across, each made up of flowerets which are little tubes
with five lobes. The foliage is small, stiff and rough, with prominent
veins, each leaf minutely scalloped. The plant is woody
and firm, by which it can be distinguished from an annual, herbaceous
Verbena which is sometimes grown as a ground cover
and has flowers of somewhat similar form and color. The Lantana
belongs to the Verbena family, accounting for the similarity.
The trailing purple Lantana comes from South America. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<p>The familiar red and yellow <i>Lantana camara</i> is often seen
in Hawaii growing wild beside the road. It is an &ldquo;escape&rdquo; from
gardens. At one time it threatened all island agriculture, for
without natural checks in the new territory to which it had been
introduced it formed dense thickets which could hardly be eradicated.
It was finally controlled by introducing parasites from
tropical America, where it is native.</p>
<h3>PIKAKE
<br /><i>Jasminum sambac Solander</i></h3>
<p>The Pikake flower is seldom seen growing, for the shrub is
rather ungainly, with large stiff paired leaves, and the blossoms
make little show. It is when these flowers are strung into leis,
however, that they become universally recognized, through their
magnificent fragrance. It is regarded by many people as the most
enchanting flower scent in the world. The individual flowers
are small, waxy, white, usually double. One lei strand is enough
to scent a room, but several are usually worn in order to make
an attractive showing.</p>
<p>It is this Jasmine that is grown commercially in China and
added to tea leaves to make Jasmine tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Its peculiar Hawaiian name (pronounced peacocki), was
probably derived from association with the white peacocks which
used to wander through Ainahau, the beautiful estate at Waikiki
where the Princess Kaiulani lived in the nineties. The lei of
Jasmine flowers was the favorite of this young heiress to the
Hawaiian throne and by a natural association of favorites, her
lei and her birds were called by the same name. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<h3>CROWN OF THORNS
<br /><i>Euphorbia splendens Bojer</i></h3>
<p>Quantities of very long, sharp thorns on a low shrub bearing
small, red flowers is the Crown of Thorns. The little, rosy-scarlet
flowers grow in small clusters on longish stems. What appear to
be two red petals are really a pair of bracts. The leaves are few,
bright green, and appear on the new growth.</p>
<p>The plant, which is usually less than three feet high, forms
a dense mass of thorns with its bare, brownish stems. It is sometimes
planted in areas from which it is desired to keep people, as
in the parking strip before the Advertiser building. The plant is
a native of Madagascar, and a member of the Euphorbia family.
(<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<p>It is a cousin of the Poinsettia, <i>Euphorbia pulcherrima</i> from
Mexico, which grows very luxuriously in Hawaii.</p>
<h3>SINGAPORE HOLLY
<br /><i>Malpighia coccigera Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Miniature, holly-like leaves, crisp, shining and thorny, mark
this charming little plant which is not a native of Singapore but
of the West Indies. Nor is it a true holly, but a member of the
Malpighia family. The plant is covered occasionally with dainty
pink flowers, their five petals around the yellow stamens, very
fringed and crepy and suggesting in form their cousins, the Orchid
vine (Stigmaphyllon). They have a slight fragrance. The plant
grows rather stiffly and is often seen in pots. (<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h3>DOMBEYA
<br /><i>Dombeya wallichii Bentham and Hooker</i></h3>
<p>The Dombeya is a shrub or small tree with large leaves
among which hang showy round, drooping heads of many pink
flowers. The flower clusters grow at the end of long, downy
pedicels and are so heavy that they hang far over. Individual
flowers have five pink petals, and the stamens are united into a
short tube in the center. Even when these flowers are brown and
dried the cluster still hangs on the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are big and velvety, roundly heart shaped, with
lobes. The plant is a native of Madagascar and a member of the
Cocoa family. A white flowering shrub of similar appearance is
the <i>Dombeya spectabilis</i>. A specimen grows in the University of
Hawaii grounds. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>
<h3>KALAMONA
<br /><i>Cassia glauca Lamarck</i></h3>
<p>A very commonly seen shrub or small tree bearing numerous
clusters of bright yellow flowers and, at the same time, bunches
of brown pods, is the Kalamona. A native of tropical Asia, this
plant has become naturalized in Hawaii and is often seen growing
wild, especially in dry places. Its yellow flowers are similar in
general form to those of its cousins, the Shower trees, and like
them also, the foliage is compound. Each leaf is made up of many
medium-sized leaflets. The flowers appear most of the year, but
are best in spring and early summer. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>) The Hawaiian
name has been transferred to this plant from a native Cassia of
similar appearance, <i>C. gaudichaudii</i>.</p>
<h3>HAOLE LEHUA
<br /><i>Calliandra grandiflora Bentham</i></h3>
<p>Flowers which are pompons of pink or white stamens, blooming
in winter and spring, announce the Haole Lehua. This name,
meaning foreign Lehua, is applied also to a closely related species,
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
<i>Calliandra haematoma</i> which has similar flowers of a bright pinkish
red. Resemblance of these flowers to those of the native Ohia
Lehua has resulted in this name being transferred. At the present
time they are more commonly seen in leis than the true Lehua.
Such leis are particularly beautiful suggesting a garland of marabou
feathers. The shrub has small compound leaves and grows
twelve feet tall. The flowers are followed by brown seedpods,
showing the plant to be a member of the bean family. It is a
native of tropical America. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>
<h3>CUP AND SAUCER PLANT. CHINAMAN&rsquo;S HAT
<br /><i>Holmskioldia sanguinea Retz</i></h3>
<p>Tall sprays of the Holmskioldia are lined with quaintly
shaped little flowers, of tawny orange or deep scarlet color. They
are well described by the names of Cup and Saucer, or Chinaman&rsquo;s
hat. Each is made up of a saucer-shaped bract, which is the most
conspicuous part, from the center of which rises a small tubular
flower. They bloom the year round and may be found in many
gardens.</p>
<p>The shrub is sprawling or half climbing, with small opposite
leaves, usually with irregular margins. It is a native of Burma and
a member of the Coffee family. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>
<h3>KONA COFFEE. ARABIAN COFFEE
<br /><i>Coffea arabica Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The shrub or small tree that produces the coffee bean of
commerce is sometimes grown in Hawaii as an ornamental plant.
It is conspicuous for its rich, dark, shining, leaves, strongly veined
and for its bright red berries and the fragrance of its small, white
flowers. The flowers are starlike, and grow rather inconspicuously
in the leaf axils, a few in a cluster. They are followed by
the green berries which turn bright red when ripe. These berries
usually contain two seeds which are the coffee &ldquo;beans&rdquo; of
commerce.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The Arabian coffee plant grows best at levels cooler than
the average in Honolulu, so the plant is seen on Tantalus and in
the high valleys. It is grown commercially in the Kona district,
on the Island of Hawaii and the product has been given the
name of Kona coffee. Most of the world&rsquo;s coffee is made from
this species, which was originally native to tropical East Africa,
but was introduced very early into Arabia. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>
<p>Another coffee plant grown in Honolulu is <i>Coffea liberica</i>,
also a native of tropical Africa. It grows under slightly warmer
conditions than the other and so does better in Honolulu. It is
larger than <i>C. arabica</i>, becoming a small tree. Coffee plants are
related to the fragrant Gardenias, and give their name to the
family.</p>
<h3>CORAL BUSH
<br /><i>Jatropha multifida Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Again the similarity of a flower to coral has given the name
of Coral Bush to a plant. In the case of the Jatropha, the likeness
is not far-fetched, for the Jatropha flower head is very curious
and strangely like a small bunch of red coral. Stems and rounded
buds are red and glossy. A few flowers open at a time, showing
five small petals and yellow stamens. The fruit which follows
is a green capsule holding several seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves of the plant are palmate, and deeply divided in
seven to eleven slender parts, giving a lacy appearance to the shrub.
It grows about ten feet high. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>
<p>Flowers of almost identical form grow on a related plant
called <i>Jatropha podagrica</i>. This plant, however, is small and
usually grown in pots. It is characterized by a greatly thickened
stalk which seems to be a large bulb rising from the ground.
Flowers and a few leaves grow from the top of this stem. The
leaves of this plant are not divided, as in the shrub, but are either
entire or lobed. Both are natives of Central America, and belong
to the Euphorbia family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h3>LASIANDRA. PLEROMA. PRINCESS FLOWER
<br /><i>Tibouchina semidecandra Cogniaux</i></h3>
<p>Flowers of rich royal purple, a regal and exciting color,
make the Lasiandra conspicuous wherever it blooms. It is not
commonly seen in Honolulu, because it prefers slightly higher
altitudes, but on the road to the Volcano on Hawaii, or at Kokee
on Kauai, it has escaped and makes conspicuous purple masses of
bloom. The flowers have five velvety petals, and in the center
a group of pinkish stamens, which are peculiarly angled.</p>
<p>The leaves are almost as attractive as the flowers being
thickly piled with velvety green hairs which create a silver sheen.
They are marked laterally by several conspicuous veins. Old leaves
scattered over the plant turn bright scarlet and are as noticeable
as flowers.</p>
<p>The plant grows as a spreading shrub. It is a native of
Brazil and a member of the Melastoma family. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>
<h3>NATAL PLUM
<br /><i>Carissa grandiflora De Candolle</i></h3>
<p>The Natal plum, (a native of Natal, in South Africa) is
characterized by its long sharp thorns, its fragrant white flowers
and its bright red fruits which shine conspicuously among the
leaves. The plant may attain almost the size of a small tree but
is usually smaller and is often used as a hedge. Its thorns make it
practically impenetrable.</p>
<p>The flowers have five, waxy, white petals which always
twist slightly to the right. They are very fragrant. The red fruits
are edible but sub-acid in flavor. The leaves are very glossy and
thick, growing opposite each other on the stem. The plant is a
member of the Periwinkle family. It may be seen growing along
the Makiki side of the Round Top road. (<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>)</p>

<p>If Hawaii does not have an autumn season when all
the leaves turn red, it has, nevertheless, certain plants
which suggest autumn all the year round, with their
gorgeously colored foliage. Brilliant tones of red, orange
and gold appear perennially in the leaves of many shrubs, while
others are more delicately colored in tints of pink, cream and
yellow-green. Still others hold very dark shades of maroon, crimson
and purple. On most of these plants the flowers are small and
inconspicuous, as if the colored leaves took their place in interest.</p>
<h3>SNOW BUSH
<br /><i>Phyllanthus nivosus Bull</i>
<br /><i>Variety roseo-pictus</i></h3>
<p>A mass of small, delicate leaves, pale pink and light green
in color, on a loose, graceful shrub, is the Snow bush. It is well
named, the effect of the frosty coloring being as if a light fall
of snow had touched the leaves. While some plants carry only
the light and dark green leaves, others show a rosy coloring in
the new growth. This variety is appropriately known as roseo-pictus.
The color is strongest in the young parts, the leaves tending
to turn to a more even green as they become older. In some,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
the pink color turns to a dull red. The leaves are rounded in form,
about an inch and a half or two inches in length, and grow alternately
on the stem. The latter is dark red, with a tendency toward
angularity.</p>
<p>Small greenish flowers sometimes hang from long stems in
the axils of the leaves, the male and female flowers being separate.</p>
<p>The plant is a native of the South Seas and a member of the
Euphorbia family. It is one of Hawaii&rsquo;s most attractive and colorful
shrubs being often used as a hedge plant. (<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>)</p>
<h3>CROTON
<br /><i>Codiaeum variegatum Blume</i></h3>
<p>Leading in interest among the colored foliage shrubs in
Hawaii is a large group of plants commonly called the Crotons.
This name, however, properly belongs to a quite different plant
but is used generally by nursery men for this Codiaeum.</p>
<p>Although these Crotons have an almost endless variety of
leaf form and color, they all belong to a single species, the difference
in appearance being only a matter of horticultural variation.
The plants are natives of Malaysia and the Pacific islands, and
are members of the Euphorbia family.</p>
<p>To illustrate the wide variations in the Croton leaves, specimens
of seven different plants are shown in the upper right hand
corner of <a href="#plateX">Plate X</a> and one more, with spiral leaves, is shown in
the lower left hand corner. These eight are perhaps the ones most
often seen in Honolulu, but they do not exhaust the local list,
and botanical books name many more varieties.</p>
<p>Croton shrubs vary in size, but most of them grow ten or
twelve feet tall. Their colors are brightest when growing in full
sunlight. Croton leaves remain fresh for some time after they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
cut, so that they lend themselves to unusual decorations. The
proper name, Codiaeum, may have been derived from the Greek
word for head, suggesting that the leaves were used to make
crowning wreaths.</p>
<p>The Croton flowers are small and white, growing in slender
racemes in the axils of the leaves. There are separate male and
female flowers.</p>
<h3>ERANTHEMUM
<br /><i>Pseuderanthemum atropurpureum</i> (<i>Bull</i>) <i>Radlkofer</i>
<br />(<i>Erantbemum purpureum</i>)</h3>
<p>A shrub which might be casually mistaken for one of the
Crotons, because of the rich coloring of its leaves, is called Eranthemum.
The leaf colors are, however, purplish, rose and pink, hues
that do not occur in the Crotons. These plants vary greatly among
themselves, some having leaves that are mottled in green and
white, others with colors that range through the pinkish purples
to dark maroon. There is a tendency for the young leaves to have
the brightest colors and to turn green as they grow older. The
leaves are opposite, strongly veined and rather unevenly margined.
The plant belongs to the Acanthus family, and is a native of the
South Sea islands. (<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>, 3)</p>
<p>A variety of the purple is the <i>eldorado</i>, a horticultural variation,
as bright and sunny in its green and gold coloring as the
former is dark and rich, deserving its name of eldorado, the golden.
The pointed leaves are margined and blotched in bright yellow,
usually with yellow veins. They grow in opposite pairs and have
a tendency to appear in bunches near the ends of the stem. The
new leaves are in two tones of yellowish green, the more striking
coloration of clear yellow developing as they age. (<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>, 4)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>There is another Eranthemum, bearing purple and white
flowers, illustrated in <a href="#plateVI">plate VI</a>.</p>
<h3>PANAX
<br /><i>Polyscias guilfoylei Bailey</i>
<br />(<i>Nothopanax guilfoylei, Cogniaux and Merrill</i>)</h3>
<p>Visitors to Hawaii are always interested in knowing the
name of the commonest hedge plant, a tall slender shrub with
grey perpendicular stems and leaves that usually are edged in
white or pale green. This is the Panax, a native of the Pacific
Islands and a member of the Aralia family.</p>
<p>This shrub is probably one of the most successful hedge
plants in the world, since it has few branches and these tend to
grow almost straight upward and the foliage is carried right down
to the ground. There are several varieties, differing slightly in
the form and coloring of leaflets. Some are a flat green, others
are edged in white or yellow, or the reverse. All tend to have
irregular toothed margins. The leaves are compound, the leaflets
opposite, the stems clasping the branch.</p>
<p>Besides the common hedge plant there are a number of
Panax varieties in Hawaii, usually grown as specimen or greenhouse
plants. One is very fine and dainty, with deeply cut, irregularly
shaped leaves. Another is curly and still another is a giant,
with leaves eight inches across.</p>
<p>The Panax very rarely flowers. (<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>)</p>
<h3>BEEFSTEAK PLANT
<br /><i>Acalypha wilkesiana J. Mueller</i> (<i>of Aargau</i>)</h3>
<p>A plant with bright red foliage, which might easily be taken
for one of the Crotons is really an Acalypha, a relative of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
striking Chenille plant illustrated in <a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>. The leaves of
this plant are large and tend to a triangular form. They are
basically a bronzy green color, with spreading blotches of pink,
red and brown, but the total effect of the plant is one of bright
red. These shrubs grow ten feet high and are sometimes used
for hedges, being always conspicuous objects on the street. There
are a number of other varieties besides the one with the bright
foliage, one having dull rose patches on bronzy leaves.</p>
<p>Insects are attracted to these leaves so that often they are
full of holes and sometimes they are reduced to lacy outlines.</p>
<p>Flowers are rather inconspicuous but of two kinds, the male
and female. The former appear as small upright spikes of reddish
tufts which are the pistils; staminate flowers are brownish and
drooping and suggest little rat-tails.</p>
<p>The Acalyphas are members of the Euphorbia family and
<i>A. wilkesiana</i> is a native of the Pacific Islands. (<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>)</p>
<h3>CARICATURE PLANT. MORADO
<br /><i>Graptophyllum pictum Griffiths</i></h3>
<p>People with good imaginations can see pictures in the yellow
or white markings on the green leaves of the Caricature plant.
No two leaves are ever quite alike but the &ldquo;picture&rdquo; appears
always in the center of the leaf rather than along the margins.
The leaves are a pointed oval in shape, smooth and rather leathery.
They grow in opposite pairs. This plant, too, often is taken
casually for one of the Crotons. The shrub will become six or
eight feet high.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, tubular and dark red. The original
home of the Graptophyllum is not known, but it grows widely
in the tropics and is popular in India. It belongs to the Acanthus
family. (<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>There is another variety with leaves of deep, purplish red
and bronze, on which the markings are in a lighter shade.</p>
<h3>OTHER COLORED FOLIAGE PLANTS</h3>
<p>In <a href="#c9">Chapter VIII</a> will be found described a number of other
plants with colored foliage which are not, however, shrubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c7">Chapter VI
<br />FLOWERING VINES</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i22.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="200" height="200" />
</div>
<p>Vines sprawling over rocks and banks, or climbing high
over walls and trees to hang out floral banners, make
up one of Hawaii&rsquo;s most colorful and interesting floral
chapters. While some vines are ever-blooming, most
have seasons when they suddenly put on a display of color or of
rare beauty, that become, often, the most conspicuous sight of
the town. The vines are rather easy to identify on the whole,
for there are only a few which resemble each other enough to be
confusing.</p>
<h3>YELLOW ALLAMANDA
<br /><i>Allamanda hendersonii Bulliard</i></h3>
<p>Sprawling green vines, often used as a ground cover, with
big yellow flowers every day in the year, are the Allamandas.
They are one of the most widely used plants in Hawaii.</p>
<p>There are two yellow species commonly seen, the only essential
difference being size. The one with large flowers, about five
inches in diameter, is <i>Allamanda hendersonii</i>. Its leaves are smooth
on both sides. The species with smaller blossoms, about three
inches in diameter, is <i>Allamanda cathartica</i>. It may be identified,
if not in bloom, by the fact that its leaves are somewhat hairy on
the under side.</p>
<p>The bright yellow flowers grow in terminal clusters, two
or three of the buds opening at one time. The buds are pointed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
those of the large <i>A. hendersonii</i> being quite brownish in color
and looking as if they had been varnished. This brown color
blotches the back of the opened flowers. Blossoms are campanulate
in form, the tube spreading out into five large, thick, velvety
lobes. The throat of the tube in the large flower is also streaked
with brown and there are whitish spots at the base of the petals.
Flowers of these vines do not last when cut, unless the stem ends
have the sticky juice coagulated by holding in very hot water.</p>
<p>The leaves usually appear in fours, forming a cross or whorl
where they join the stem. They are a pointed oval in form, thick,
smooth and rather light green.</p>
<p>These plants are natives of Guiana and members of the Periwinkle
family. There is a fine planting at Vancouver drive and
Hunnewell street. (<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>)</p>
<h3>PINK ALLAMANDA
<br /><i>Allamanda blachetti A. De Candolle</i></h3>
<p>The rose-colored member of the Allamanda group in Hawaii
is not so often found as the yellow. The flowers are about the
size of the large yellow and in color a deep rose, or almost maroon,
with the throat a deeper shade.</p>
<p>The leaves of this species, while they display the whorled
growth of the yellow, are smaller and very rough and hairy on
both sides.</p>
<p>The vine comes from Brazil. (<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>)</p>
<h3>BABY MORNING GLORY
<br /><i>Jacquemontia pentantha G. Don</i>
<br />(<i>Convolvulus mauritanicus</i>)</h3>
<p>Flowers like miniature blue morning-glories, about an inch
across, grow on this slender vine. It is charming because of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
petite size, and for the beautiful color of the flowers. They have
a lighter throat, and white stamens. The buds appear in clusters
at the end of the flower stem and one or two flowers open each
morning, closing in the afternoon. The leaves are slightly heart-shaped,
ending in a sharp point. The stems are reddish. The
Jacquemontia, which is a native of tropical America, was named
after a French botanist, Victor Jacquemont. Formerly it was
called <i>Convolvulus mauritanicus</i>. (<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>)</p>
<h3>ORANGE TRUMPET VINE. FIRECRACKER VINE. HUAPALA
<br /><i>Bignonia venusta Ker</i></h3>
<p>One of the most spectacular events in Hawaii&rsquo;s colorful
floral calendar, is the blooming of the Firecracker vine. In late
winter, walls of green foliage turn suddenly into a sheet of flaming
orange, the masses of flowers seeming like small tongues of
fire blazing over the entire vine.</p>
<p>The blossoms grow in end racemes. Each individual flower
is a long, slender tube spreading into four or five lobes which
curl back against the tube. They often form the outline of a
cross, with the fourth lobe split, curiously, into two parts to
make the five-part flower. The style and four stamens extend
beyond the tube. When the flower begins to fade, the tube slips
loose from the calyx; but it is often caught in its fall by the
enlarged tip of the style, so that the flower hangs on the vine,
to add its color to the mass, for a while longer.</p>
<p>Leaves are glossy and bright green, usually growing as three
rather pointed leaflets. Like so many other vines in Hawaii, it
is a native of Brazil. The Hawaiian name, &ldquo;Huapala&rdquo; means
Sweetheart. (<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h3>&ldquo;MAUNA LOA&rdquo;. PUA KAUHI
<br /><i>Canavalia microcarpa De Candolle</i></h3>
<p>Anyone who has remained for long in Hawaii has seen and
wondered at the Maunaloa leis, those strangely formal, almost
sculptured floral bands which have scale-like, overlapping petals
in the center, and are bordered on either edge by rounded projections.
The flowers from which these leis are made are a typical
pea blossom. Strung together and turned right and left alternately,
the &ldquo;banner&rdquo; or large top petal is then bent back and
held down by being pressed onto the surface of a narrow strip of
adhesive tape stretched along the length of the lei. The &ldquo;keel&rdquo;
of the pea flower forms the border projections.</p>
<p>Originally these leis were made from the Maunaloa flowers,
which are botanically <i>Dioclea altissima</i>. But these are rarely seen
nowadays and most of the Maunaloa leis are made from a closely
related flower, the <i>Canavalia microcarpa</i>. The blossoms of this
vine range in color from white, through orchid pink to lavender
and even maroon. They grow in elongated clusters at the tips of
the shoots. The stems of the plant are dark red, the leaves are
made up of three leaflets, triangular in form, with reddish venetions.
This plant is an annual, growing from large, dark roundish
seeds. It is a native of Brazil and grows wild in Hawaii. (<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>)</p>
<p>The true Maunaloa is very similar to it in general form.</p>
<h3>PINK BIGNONIA
<br /><i>Pandorea jasminoides Schumann</i></h3>
<p>There are several kinds of vines growing in Honolulu which
have clusters of pink or orchid colored trumpet shaped flowers,
often with a dark red throat. These are usually called vaguely
Pink Bignonia, for they are either members of the Bignonia family
or closely related. Their botanical relationships are not easily
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
straightened out for the layman, since all are rather similar in
appearance. On <a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a> is shown <i>Pandorea jasminoides</i>, a vine
from Australia. Others are <i>Bignonia jasminoides</i> and <i>Bignonia
regina</i> from tropical America. All are attractive with their pinkish
bell-shaped flowers and fine green foliage. <i>Pandorea jasminoides</i>
may be seen growing on a wall on the lower part of
Diamond Head Road.</p>
<h3>WOODEN ROSE
<br /><i>Ipomoea tuberosa Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>One of the strangest and most attractive of Hawaii&rsquo;s plant
novelties is the &ldquo;Wooden Rose,&rdquo; which looks indeed like some
wonderful bit of carving, rubbed to an exquisite satiny brown
finish. The &ldquo;rose&rdquo; however, is really the dried seed pod of a species
of morning-glory, as anyone familiar with the ordinary morning-glory
seed will at once recognize. The central ball holds the seeds
while the enlarged, dried calyx which surrounds it, appears to be
petals.</p>
<p>In Hawaii, the vine is a perennial, grown from seeds. Its
strong shoots spread rampantly during the summer month, climbing
high into trees or covering buildings and fences. The leaf is
divided into seven pointed lobes. The flowers first appear in
autumn. They are yellow, small, rather inconspicuous and
tubular, like the small yellow morning-glory which they really are.
After they fall, the calyx begins to develop until it has enlarged
into what looks like an immense pointed, cream-colored bud. As
this begins to dry, it opens, showing the enlarged seed case. In
a few days, the &ldquo;wood rose&rdquo; is stiff and brown. About three
months are required from the time the blossom appears until the
seed pod is ready to cut. These pods may be used as a long-lived
decoration; and, since the flowers grow at intervals along the
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
shoot in the leaf axils, graceful lengths of stem with many roses
can be used for flower arrangements.</p>
<p>The vine grows generally throughout the tropics but is sometimes
called Ceylon Morning-glory. (<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>)</p>
<h3>CAT&rsquo;S CLAW VINE. HUG-ME-TIGHT
<br /><i>Bignonia unguis-cati Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>The three-pointed, claw-like tendrils by which this vine
clings closely to trees, or walls, have given it the two names by
which it is commonly known. But it will be readily recognized
and remembered from the cloth of gold it flings several times a
year over everything it covers. Individual flowers are trumpet
shaped, with five spreading lobes, about two inches across. The
color is a clear, canary yellow. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<p>The leaves are compound, the paired leaflets being pointed
and narrow. The plant is a native of tropical America where it
is related to some of the giant lianas that creep through the Brazilian
jungle. Its most conspicuous relative in Honolulu is the Firecracker
vine, <i>Bignonia venusta</i>, illustrated on <a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>.</p>
<h3>GALPHIMIA VINE
<br /><i>Tristellateia australis A. Richard</i></h3>
<p>This yellow flowering vine is rather rare as yet in Honolulu,
but is bound to grow in popularity as its attractive flowers and
leaves become known. The color of the leaves is a light yellow-green.
They are opposite, smooth, thick and waxen, with a
tendency to fold along the mid-rib.</p>
<p>The flowers appear on pendant end-shoots, in long clusters.
They have five, pale, yellow petals and in the center a group of
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
short, red stamens. Probably this vine can be most readily identified
by this touch of red in the middle of the yellow blossom.
It belongs to the Malpighia family and hence is a cousin of the
popular Galphimia shrub. It is a native of Australasia. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<h3>GIANT POTATO VINE
<br /><i>Solanum wendlandii Hooker</i></h3>
<p>Delicate, pale, periwinkle-blue flowers appear in large, loose,
clusters in early summer and again in autumn on the Giant Potato
vine. The petals of the flowers are not separate, but are connected,
curving outward slightly, making the flower almost pentagonal
in outline. The mid-rib of each petal is of slightly different
texture and lighter color than the rest of the corolla. In the
center of the flower is a group of thick stamens forming a low
column.</p>
<p>The leaves of this vine are not all of one shape, but vary
in form from a simple outline to one that is deeply lobed, with
the end lobe sometimes larger than the others. The leaves are
smooth in texture but have occasional prickles. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<p>Another &ldquo;Potato vine&rdquo; in Hawaii is <i>Solanum seaforthianum</i>.
It has small flowers of a rich purple-blue, about an inch across,
which appear in loose clusters in summer. They are of the same
pentagonal form as the larger ones and have a bright yellow center
created by the stamen.</p>
<p>The foliage of <i>S. seaforthianum</i> is small; but, like the large
potato vine, varies in form.</p>
<p>The giant vine is a native of Costa Rica while the smaller
one came from Brazil. Both belong to the Solanum, or nightshade
family.</p>
<p>A close relative is the Giant Potato Tree which has flowers
of very similar form and color. See <a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h3>PHANERA
<br /><i>Bauhinia corymbosa Roxburgh</i></h3>
<p>The Phanera carries large, loose, corymbose clusters of small
pale, pinkish flowers, during the summer months. The flowers
are about an inch across and have five delicately fluted white
petals. These may be flushed with pink. Several long bright red
stamens project from the center and give the flower cluster a
pinkish effect.</p>
<p>The leaves seem to be paired, but are really deeply lobed,
their outer edges rounded, the notch cut in deeply. The nerves
are almost parallel. This peculiar leaf shows the relationship of
this vine to other members of the same family, especially the
Orchid tree and the St. Thomas tree. The genus was named for
the twin Bauhin brothers who were herbalists in the 16th century.</p>
<p>The flowers are followed by long, flat, purplish-brown pods,
showing this plant belongs to the legume family. Its native home
is China. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<h3>SANDPAPER VINE. PURPLE WREATH
<br /><i>Petrea volubilis Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>One of the most exciting experiences in Hawaii is to come
upon a plant of the Petrea in full bloom. The cascading racemes
of lavender-blue flowers cover the plant completely, turning it
into a tumbling fall of lacy blue. The calyx seems like a flower
in itself, being starlike, five pointed and periwinkle blue. The
true flower is a rich violet in color and looks something like a
real violet growing in the center of the calyx. This true blossom
falls off the plant in a day or so, leaving the calyxes to suggest
a cluster of Wistaria blossoms. Each raceme is seven or eight
inches long and carries fifteen to thirty flowers. The plant blooms
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
several times during the year, at least once in spring and again
in summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are yellowish or grey-green and very rough in
feeling. They give the plant its name of Sandpaper vine. It is
a native of Brazil and a member of the Verbena family. A specimen
may be seen on Metcalf street, near Hunnewell. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<h3>ORCHID VINE
<br /><i>Stigmaphyllon littorale A. Jussieu</i></h3>
<p>Clusters of delicate, yellow flowers, suggesting small yellow
orchids have given the name of Orchid to the two Stigmaphyllons
which grow in Hawaii. They are, however, in no way related to
Orchids but belong to the Malpighia family. In recent years they
have become very popular in Honolulu but cannot yet be found
widespread in gardens.</p>
<p>Individual blossoms have five unequal petals of a crepy,
satiny, texture and a clear bright yellow color. The flower illustrated
in <a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a> is <i>Stigmaphyllon littorale</i>. Its flowers are
smaller and more numerous than the cousin, which is <i>Stigmaphyllon
ciliatum</i>, but the form of the two flowers is very much alike.
The foliage of the two plants, however, is different for while both
have strong, leathery, shining leaves, those of <i>S. littorale</i> are oval,
while those of <i>S. ciliatum</i> are small, pointed, quaintly heart-shaped
and as the botanist says, they are &ldquo;ciliate,&rdquo; that is, fringed by
coarse hairs. From this is derived its specific name of ciliatum.</p>
<p>These two vines are natives of tropical America.</p>
<h3>GARLIC VINE
<br /><i>Cydista aequinoctialis Miers</i></h3>
<p>A vine with charming clusters of orchid-colored, bell-shaped
flowers, radiates a most disagreeable odor of bad garlic, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
gives it the inevitable name of Garlic Vine, or, since it is a species
of the widespread Bignonia family, the name of garlic-scented
Bignonia. The flowers appear most prolifically in autumn and
spring, but a few may be found almost any time. The white-throated
tube of the blossom is slightly flattened and then broadens
into five lobes of a purplish-orchid color. At the bottom of
the tube are yellow stamens.</p>
<p>The leaves are a rich, glossy green, growing in opposite pairs,
so that four appear to grow from one point on the stem. A
straight tendril extends from between the pairs near the end of
the branch. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<h3>MEXICAN CREEPER. CHAIN OF LOVE
<br /><i>Antigonon leptopus Hooker and Arnott</i></h3>
<p>Lace-like masses of small, bright-pink flowers clambering
by curling tendrils over weeds, rocks or trees, announce the
Mexican creeper. Sometimes the white variety is seen and there
are also pale pink hybrids. In its native Latin America, this plant
is called <i>Cadena del Amor</i>, or Chain of Love, since the flowers
suggest a string of small pink hearts. The Mexicans have also
given it other sentimental names such as <i>Rosa de Montana</i>, <i>Corallita</i>
and <i>San Miguelito</i>.</p>
<p>The flower chains branch in a rather angular way giving
an effect that is peculiarly picturesque. They lend themselves to
flower arrangements of special charm. For this purpose the white
variety is often more useful than the bright pink, since it blends
better with the average interior color scheme. The only drawback
is that the flowers fall rather quickly, but they are worth
arranging even for a short time.</p>
<p>The leaves are heart-shaped with wavy margins. There are
no petals, the colored portion of the flower being the calyx, with
five petal-like sepals. The seeds form and remain inside the dried
calyx. The plant belongs to the buckwheat family. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>

<h3>CUP OF GOLD
<br /><i>Solandra guttata Don</i></h3>
<p>One of the most magnificent flowers in Hawaii is the great
Cup of Gold blossom. It could be more appropriately called a
golden chalice than a mere cup, for the blossom is nine inches long
above its stem-like tube, and wide and curving in outline. It is
the rich golden color of a ripe banana, and brownish streaks on
the petals increase this suggestion. Its fragrance, however, is the
deep, heady scent of ripe apricots. The huge buds, waxen in
texture, when they once start to unfold, move so rapidly that the
backward curving movement may be easily observed. The plant
blooms in the winter and spring months. Its leaves are large and
rather pointed. (<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>)</p>
<p>There is a very similar flower which is cream-white in color,
hence called the Silver Cup. This is Solandra grandiflora. These
two are members of the Potato family. They are natives of
Mexico and tropical America, where they are called in Spanish,
<i>Copa de Oro</i>.</p>
<h3>BLEEDING HEART. BAG FLOWER
<br /><i>Clerodendron thomsonae Balfour</i></h3>
<p>The quaint little red and white flowers of this vine appear
in clusters during the winter and spring months. The vine is
usually rather small and is often grown in pots. The crimson
portion is the true flower, while the &ldquo;heart&rdquo; or &ldquo;bag&rdquo; is the
white calyx. The red flower is composed of a slender tube extending
beyond the calyx and spreading into five lobes. A group
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
of fine stamens protrudes beyond the flower. The leaves are
opposite, oblong-ovate, and slightly rough to the touch.</p>
<p>This Clerodendron, which is a member of the Verbena
family, is a native of West Africa. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<h3>KUHIO VINE. PRINCE&rsquo;S VINE
<br /><i>Ipomoea horsfalliae Hooker</i></h3>
<p>A close covering mass of magenta-crimson flowers in
autumn, winter or spring, is almost sure to be the Kuhio Vine.
(The Crimson Lake Bougainvillea, though of about the same
color, hangs in long swaying sprays.) The Kuhio vine, one of
the morning-glories, is a native of India and is found growing
widely in the tropics. It was brought to Hawaii by Prince Kuhio
when he was the Territory&rsquo;s delegate in Washington. For years,
a large vine grew over his house at Waikiki, on that portion of
the beach now known as Kuhio Park. It is natural that the plant
should have been called the Prince&rsquo;s vine, or Kuhio vine.</p>
<p>Individual flowers are shaped like a long bell with a waxy
tube and a wide mouth, made up of five lobes. The leaves are
a dark, rich green and divided, usually, into five parts. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<h3>PORANA VINE
<br /><i>Porana paniculata Roxburgh</i></h3>
<p>A mass of tiny white flowers, so small and so numerous they
suggest a drift of smoke, or a light fall of snow, is the Porana
vine in bloom. The flowering period is late summer and autumn.
The rest of the year the plant carries its thick, grey, felt-like
leaves along walls and trellises. The leaves are opposite, either
heart-shaped or oval, and rather large.</p>
<p>Individual flowers are shaped like minute white morning-glories,
the Porana being a member of this family. The tiny
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
white blossoms appear in huge lacy panicles at the end of the
branches. They can be used as cut flowers for a short period
before the blossoms begin to fall, and they are popular for use in
bridal bouquets in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The Porana is a native of India and Malaya, where it grows
to a great height in the jungles. Its name is said to be derived
from the native Javanese name. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<h3>CRIMSON LAKE BOUGAINVILLEA
<br /><i>Bougainvillea glabra, var. Sanderiana Choisy</i></h3>
<p>Long, waving sprays of bright crimson flowers are a conspicuous
feature of Honolulu gardens in winter, spring, and early
summer. These sprays grow on the Crimson Lake Bougainvillea,
a close cousin of the purple flowering species which is so familiar
in California and other temperate areas. The purple forms grow
in Hawaii, also. One of them, <i>Bougainvillea spectabilis</i>, is a mass
of purple in the spring; its smaller, ever-blooming form is the
variety <i>parviflora</i>. This same group includes, also, the orange and
tawny-hued form, which is <i>B. spectabilis</i>, variety <i>lateritia</i>.</p>
<p>Flower shades of all these plants vary considerably, the
purple hues ranging through lavender and pink, while the entire
color range in golden tones appears in the lateritia, varying from
a golden buff through rich terra cotta red, to orange and almost
scarlet. All are practically alike in form. The brilliant color is
not due to the true flower but to modified leaves or bracts,
three of which enclose the true flowers. The latter are small,
tubular and pale yellow. The leaves of the plant are small, rather
triangular in shape, with wavy margins.</p>
<p>The stems of Crimson Lake have large thorns. The plant
climbs strongly during the summer months, then in winter, its
clusters of flowers appear at the end of its branches. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The orange or terracotta-colored variety makes a gorgeous
mass of flaming color in the winter season while the purples add
their exotic hue to the kaleidoscope. The grounds of St. Louis
College make a feature of purple and red Bougainvillea, while
Punahou School has a fine plant of the orange.</p>
<p>Bougainvilleas are natives of Brazil. They were named for
de Bougainville, a French navigator who lived from 1729 to
1811. The plant belongs to the four o&rsquo;clock family.</p>
<h3>WHITE THUNBERGIA
<br /><i>Thunbergia grandiflora Roxburgh Var. alba.</i></h3>
<p>One of the most conspicuous flowers in Hawaii carries starry
white flowers about four inches across against its green wall of
leaves, or dramatically drops these flowers in waving streamers
sometimes two or three feet long.</p>
<p>Rows of buds develop at the branch ends and the flowers
begin to open at the top. As they open, the branch grows also
until it nearly doubles its first length.</p>
<p>The individual flowers are funnel-shaped with a pale yellow
throat, the tube broadening to five lobes. Leaves are roughly
oval, or shaped like an angular heart, and are quite rough to the
touch. Because of the dramatic appearance of the long white
streamers, the plant has become very popular in Honolulu in
recent years. It is a native of India, a member of the Acanthus
family. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<p>The blue flowering species, <i>Thunbergia laurifolia</i> was established
much earlier than the white variety. The latter however
has outstripped the former in popularity. The blue Thunbergia
does not trail its flowers so conspicuously as does the white and
has leaves which suggest the laurel, giving the specific name,
<i>laurifolia</i> to the plant. It is sometimes called Blue Sky Flower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h3>WAX VINE
<br /><i>Hoya carnosa R. Brown</i></h3>
<p>Noticeable for its thick, shining, oval leaves is the Wax Vine.
Hidden among the leaves are the clusters of fragrant, waxy, white
flowers. They grow in umbels, the flower stems radiating from
a single point on the main stem. The small blossoms are shaped
like creamy-white stars, and each flower contains a smaller star
in its center. This is white against a pink flush at the base of
the petals. In another variety, the flower is brownish. They give
off a strong fragrance, especially in the evening. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<h3>BEAUMONTIA VINE. NEPAL TRUMPET FLOWER
<br /><i>Beaumontia grandiflora Wallich</i></h3>
<p>Immense clusters of large, striking, white flowers seen on a
strong rampant vine, mean that the Beaumontia is in bloom. The
season is winter and spring. The flowers are about six inches
across, papery in texture and a dead white in color, except for
a pink flush on the back, and pale green in the center. They are
cup shaped, with five wavy lobes. In the center of the flower
rise the five stamens, white and pale green in color and joined at
the tip into a point. The flower has a delicate fragrance, matching
its fragile appearance. If cut early in the morning and
plunged deeply into water for awhile, it will be successful as a
cut flower. The blossoms are often used in wedding bouquets in
Hawaii.</p>
<p>The vine grows to a large size with long, large leaves prominently
veined and a shining bright green in color. The plant
is a native of tropical Asia. It is a member of the Periwinkle
family. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>
<h3>BLUE BUTTERFLY PEA
<br /><i>Clitoria ternatea Linnaeus</i></h3>
<p>Blossoms of a true cerulean blue are exceedingly rare in the
flower world, but those of the Butterfly Pea are of this hue.
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
Though small and scattered on the vine, these little flowers are
delightful for their gorgeous color and unusual shape. As members
of the pea family, they are shaped like a modified pea
blossom, the &ldquo;banner&rdquo; or large back petal being oval, the wings
very small. The banner usually has a white mark on the base.
Sometimes the flowers occur double and there is also a white
variety.</p>
<p>The foliage is compound, the leaflets being rounded. The
plant, which is an annual in colder climates, grows rather thickly.
The dried pea-like pods which follow the flowers hang on the
vine a long time. The seeds grow easily.</p>
<p>The plant gets its name from the island of Ternate in the
East Indies, but is considered a cosmopolitan in the tropics. (<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>)</p>

<h2 id="c8">Chapter VII
<br />GINGER BLOSSOMS</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i27.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="199" height="200" />
</div>
<p>Leading among Hawaii&rsquo;s special flowers are those of
the Ginger family. They are usually exotic in form,
colorful, and often intoxicatingly fragrant. The name,
Ginger, covers several groups or genera, which vary
considerably in appearance although the botanist can distinguish
the similarities which relate them. Gingers are not far removed
from the Cannas and Bananas; hence, they are reedlike plants,
with fibrous stalks and blade-shaped leaves. Some are short,
hardly more than a ground cover, others grow twelve or fifteen
feet in height.</p>
<p>A native ginger, called Awapuhi by the Hawaiians, and
<i>Zingiber zerumbet</i>, by the botanist, grows in the Hawaiian forests.
Its leaves form a ground cover a foot or two high. In
spring the flower heads spring up, bulbous and reddish, composed
of scaly bracts out of which appear the small, inconspicuous,
yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant from whose root is made the dried ginger of
gingerbread also grows in Hawaii. It is called Chinese Ginger or
<i>Zingiber officinalis</i>. From its light-skinned rhizome is made the
Chinese candied and preserved ginger, and bits of the fresh root,
or the young shoot, often add piquancy to Chinese cooking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h3>SHELL GINGER. PINK PORCELAIN GINGER
<br /><i>Alpinia nutans Roxburgh</i></h3>
<p>Like a strand of closely strung shells, the buds of the Shell
Ginger droop gracefully from the ends of the stalks. Each bud
is thin and porcelain-like, white, pointed and tipped with bright
pink. These shell-like buds open, a few at a time, and the flower
pushes out. It has thin, white petals while a larger, ruffled portion
is yellow, marked with red vein-like lines. One of the
stamens also has a petal-like development. The fruit is a yellow
ball.</p>
<p>The plant is made up of luxuriant stalks of long-bladed
leaves which grow five to twelve feet high. It is a native of the
East Indies. (<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>
<p>Another ginger of this genus, <i>Alpinia mutica</i>, is conspicuous
in Hawaii not so much for its flowers, which are also yellow
and white, as for its bright, orange-colored fruit&mdash;like round
balls. These remain on the plant a long time and make good cut
decorations.</p>
<h3>YELLOW GINGER
<br /><i>Hedychium flavum Roxburgh</i></h3>
<p>The Yellow Ginger has flowers like slender moths of pale,
creamy, yellow. They rise at the end of narrow tubes above a
green head composed of scaly bracts. One blossom emerges from
behind each scale and the buds of those above it peep out like
yellow quills. The flower has three petals, two paired and wing-like,
the third large and looking like a second pair of wings, folded
together. There are three slender sepals and a long filament of
deeper color, holding the pistil and stamen. Yellow Ginger blossoms
have a delicate fragrance, delightful when perfectly fresh,
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
a little rank when the least bit wilted. Leis made before the buds
open, have the smooth quality of old ivory carvings.</p>
<p>The plant has characteristic canes of long leaves which grow
five to eight feet. It prefers cool locations, growing wild along
the Nuuanu Pali road. Yellow Ginger is a native of India. (<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>
<h3>CREPE GINGER. COSTUS
<br /><i>Costus speciosus Smith</i>
<br />(<i>Costus spicatus</i><a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>)</h3>
<p>Ruffled and fringed white flowers of odd form emerge,
two or three at a time, from behind the scales of the large,
brownish-red bracts of the costus. These form a dark head, often
so large as to suggest a pineapple. The white flowers have a curious
structure. The three, true petals are white and rather inconspicuous
behind a large, crepy, white portion which seems to be the petal
but is really a greatly modified stamen, called a staminoidium.
This rolls into a bell form, with fringed and fluted edges and a
pale yellow throat. A second modified stamen carries the anthers
and has a yellow tip, making it appear like the usual center of a
flower. The stems of this plant have a tendency to curve spirally.
The leaves are not so long and blade-like as in other gingers and
are arranged spirally on the stem. The plant is a native of the
East Indies. (<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>
<h3>RED GINGER. OSTRICH PLUME GINGER
<br /><i>Alpinia purpurata</i> (<i>Vieillard</i>) <i>Schumann</i></h3>
<p>Long rosy red heads among the green leaves are sufficiently
suggestive of ostrich plumes to justify this name for the Red
Flowering Ginger. The head is made up of large, thin, petal-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
bracts and is the conspicuous portion. The true flowers are small
and whitish and appear occasionally from behind the bracts. A
curious characteristic of this plant is that adventitious plantlets
form in the head. These grow easily when planted.</p>
<p>Red Ginger is a native of Malaya. (<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>
<h3>KAHILI GINGER
<br /><i>Hedychium gardnerianum Roscoe</i></h3>
<p>The local name for this ginger is derived from the <i>kahili</i>, an
item that was part of the regalia of early Hawaiian chieftains. A
<i>kahili</i> was made from a pole or wand, near the top of which, and
at right angles to it, were affixed long wing or tail feathers from
certain large birds, forming a cylindrical head. This was carried,
like a banner, wherever the chief went, to announce his rank and
presence.</p>
<p>The blossoming head of the Ginger called after the <i>kahili</i>
shows an obvious resemblance. The small yellow flowers on long,
stem-like tubes form a cylinder around the top of the stalk, while
the resemblance to feathers is enhanced by long, red, filaments
which are very striking against the yellow of the petals. Individual
flowers have the general form of the Yellow Ginger, but
are much smaller and their color is not creamy, but bright yellow.
The flower stalks may be six feet long and rise above the rest of
the plant. This species is native to the lower Himalayan region.
(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>
<h3>WHITE GINGER. GINGER LILY
<br /><i>Hedychium coronarium Koenig</i></h3>
<p>Most romantic of all the Gingers, because of its white, etherial
delicacy and enchanting fragrance, the White Ginger blossom
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
is larger and fuller than the yellow, but has the same moth-like
form. The petals, however, hold a shimmering, almost crystalline
moon-whiteness which seems unearthly. The slender filament
rises in the center like an insect antenna. The flowers are lifted
in snowy clusters above the lush green of their long leaves, each
flower head centered by a smooth, waxen, green bulb made up
of the scale-like bracts. Behind each bract a flower bud pushes
out. Just before they open these buds are strung into leis which
are one of the favorites in the Islands.</p>
<p>The plant will grow to eight feet if the soil is moist. It is
a native of tropical Asia. (<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>
<h3>TORCH GINGER
<br /><i>Phaeomeria magnifica</i> (<i>Roscoe</i>) <i>Schumann</i>
<br />(<i>Phaeomeria speciosa</i>)</h3>
<p>If the White Ginger is the most romantic of this group of
plants, the Torch Ginger is the most magnificent and spectacular.
The plant is a clump of tall bamboo-like stalks, fifteen feet high,
carrying large leaf blades. There are two varieties red and pink,
the one with red flowers having bronzy leaves, while the pink
has bright green leaves. Under this clump, in spring, seeming
almost like an independent plant, pushes up the large flower
stalk. It grows from three to six feet tall and carries no leaves,
but at the end develops the head which is one of the most showy
things in the flower world.</p>
<p>It is a waxen cone made up of innumerable bracts, pink or
red, around which is a frill-like involucre of the same colors.
The head is most attractive before the small, inconspicuous flowers
begin to appear from behind the bracts, making them rather
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
ragged. The general form of the flower head suggests a formalized
torch. The flowers lend themselves to arrangements that
can be almost monumental.</p>
<p>Torch ginger is a native of the Netherlands East Indies.
(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>)</p>

<br />SPECIAL TROPICAL FLOWERS</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i28.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital" width="196" height="201" />
</div>
<p>Many plants grow out of doors in Hawaii which are
only seen in greenhouses in cooler climates. These include
Orchids, which often make purple cascades from
baskets hanging on trees, and other kinds which grow
in the ground. In Hawaii, however, as in other places, the finer
collections of Orchids are grown in greenhouses. This is not for
warmth, since the walls of these houses are partly of wire screening,
but to protect the plants from rain, wind and insects. The
best plants of the island Orchid collections are usually displayed
twice a year, at spring and autumn shows in the Honolulu Academy
of Arts, where anyone interested may view them.</p>
<p>Plants which appear particularly tropical and exotic are
those with large, lush, leaves and strange colorful flowers. Such
plants do not require growing conditions any more tropical than
do other things listed in previous chapters, but they look as if
they did and are here grouped together. The ones selected for
description do not exhaust the list by any means, but they are,
perhaps, the ones most frequently seen.</p>
<p>A good collection of tropical exotics grows in the greenhouse
at the Foster Gardens, a city park open to the public.</p>
<h3>SPIDER LILIES
<br /><i>Crinum species</i></h3>
<p>In Hawaii the name of Spider Lily is given to a number of
liliaceous plants which have similar flowers, that is, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
six, thin, spidery petals and six stamens. By a stretch of the
imagination these flowers might be thought of as giant white
spiders. The botany of these lilies is much confused and the local
ones have never been satisfactorily straightened out. But there
are at least three groups covered by the popular name, the chief
one being Crinum. Others are Hymenocallis and Pancratium.
All are members of the Amaryllis family.</p>
<p>These plants have bulbous roots which send up a clump
of long, blade-like leaves. They vary from one or two feet in
length to giants four to six feet long. The flowers are usually
white, although sometimes tinged with dark red, and sometimes
they have red stamens and stems. Many of these flowers are
very fragrant. The Spider lilies are one of the staples of a Hawaiian
garden. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<h3>THE BANANA FAMILY</h3>
<p>Plants related to the Banana or Musa family, supply some
of the most exotically shaped and colored flowers in Hawaii. The
fruiting Banana does not have conspicuous flowers, but it grows
as a graceful tree. The flowering stalk holds large dark red
bracts under which are the small yellow tubular flowers. These
point upward, as do the fruits into which they develop. The man
in the fruit store hangs the bunch upside down.</p>
<p>A relative of the Banana which often attracts attention is
the Traveller&rsquo;s Palm, <i>Ravenala madagascariensis</i>, which is not, of
course, a palm any more than a Banana is a palm. The Traveller&rsquo;s
Palm has the large leaves of the Banana, but they are arranged in
one plane, like the sticks of a giant fan. Some other members of
the Banana family are included in <a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>.</p>
<h3>WHITE BIRD OF PARADISE
<br /><i>Strelitzia nicolai Thunberg</i></h3>
<p>One of the most curious flowers in Hawaii is the White Bird
of Paradise, so called, no doubt, because of its resemblance to its
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
relative, the blue and orange colored Bird of Paradise. The resemblance,
however, is not close enough for the white really to
look like a bird, as does the orange. The white flowers grow out
of a large boat-shaped sheath or keel, deep purplish grey in color,
of which there are often two or three in a cluster. The flowers
break out of the top of this sheath, one at a time, like white sails.
There are three petals with a pale blue staminodium. The keel
frequently is smeared with a gummy substance which must be
removed before the flower becomes attractive for decoration.</p>
<p>The plant on which they grow is a small tree, with Banana-like
leaves, arranged in several small fans on the order of the
Traveller&rsquo;s Palm. It is a member of the Banana family and a
native of South Africa. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<h3>BIRD OF PARADISE
<br /><i>Strelitzia reginae Banks</i></h3>
<p>The long stalk of this flower looks like the neck of a bird
holding a head with long beak and a gorgeous crest. The &ldquo;head&rdquo;
is a pointed sheath, greyish in color, and the crest of the bird is
made up of the flowers lifting out of this sheath. There are about
six of them in the sheath and since one pushes out every day
or so, the cluster becomes larger and more colorful as it becomes
older. Each flower has three pointed petals, brilliantly orange in
color, and a blue staminodium shaped like an arrow head. The
effect is unusual and exotic in the extreme. The flower is
scentless.</p>
<p>The flower stalks grow slightly above the clump of stiff
leaves which compose the plant. The leaves, which may be three
or four feet long, are paddle shaped and heavy, their edges curving
together. This plant, too, is a relative of the Banana and a native
of South Africa.</p>
<p>In arranging Bird of Paradise flowers, an effective way is
to place them with all the &ldquo;heads&rdquo; turned in one direction, which
gives the suggestion of a flock of birds in flight. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h3>GOLDEN HELICONIA
<br /><i>Heliconia latispatha Bentham</i></h3>
<p>Other relatives of the Banana are the Heliconias of which
there are a number growing in Hawaii. The plant is made up
of a clump of tall, paddle-shaped leaves, often ten feet high. The
flowers of most species grow below the leaves, but the Golden
Heliconia flower pushes above them.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a series of narrow, pointed keels,
a deep golden yellow in color. The real flowers are inside these
sheaths, inconspicuous and hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>This plant is a native of tropical America. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<h3>LOBSTER CLAW
<br /><i>Heliconia humilis Jacquin</i></h3>
<p>Generally similar to the Golden Heliconia, the keels of the
Lobster Claw are much thicker and closer together, and arranged
on opposite sides of the stem, in one plane. They are the brilliant
red of a boiled lobster and the general form of the keel suggests
the claws of the creature. The inconspicuous flowers are inside.
As the keels hold rain water, the flowers often start to decay while
the sheaths are still bright and fresh, giving a sour, disagreeable
smell to the stalk, until it has been thoroughly washed. This done,
they last a long time as decorations. The plant is a clump of tall
leaves. It is a native of tropical America. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<p>There are a number of other Heliconias, one of the most
commonly seen having sheaths that are pinkish, edged with yellow
and green. This is <i>Heliconia elongata</i>.</p>
<h3>ANTHURIUM. FLAMINGO FLOWER
<br /><i>Anthurium andraeanum Linden</i></h3>
<p>Among the most popular of Hawaii&rsquo;s exotic flowers are the
Anthuriums, for the very good reason that they will last as long
as three weeks if they are cut in their prime. They are, besides,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
large and exquisitely waxen, ranging in color from pure white,
through all shades of pink to deep, rich red. They belong to the
Arum family, of which the Calla lily is also a member, and the
Anthurium blossom is similar in general form to the Calla. That
is, it possesses a large, heart-shaped bract, called the spathe, which
is thick and waxen, almost artificial in appearance. From this
spathe rises a column, called the spadix, which may be white,
pinkish or yellow in color. Packed tightly together on this column
are the true flowers, usually so small they are hardly noticeable.
When fertilized they may develop small berries with seeds, which
grow readily.</p>
<p>The leaves are heart shaped and rather long stemmed and
spring from a central stalk. Usually they are grown in pots but
sometimes are seen in the ground. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<p>This Anthurium is a native of Colombo.</p>
<p>There are a number of other Anthuriums, but none with
such fine blossoms grows in Hawaii. The others here are foliage
plants with beautiful, large, velvety leaves, decoratively veined.</p>
<h3>PINK OR PURPLE FLOWERING BANANA
<br /><i>Musa rosacea Jacquin</i></h3>
<p>Hawaii has one species of Banana which is grown for its
flowers alone, since the small fruits it bears are not edible. This
is the Purple Flowering Banana which consists of a pointed head
of rosy orchid-colored bracts. These bracts fall open two or
three at a time to reveal the small, upstanding, tubular, yellow
flowers which grow in &ldquo;hands&rdquo; part way around the stalk. As
in the fruiting Banana, the flowers nearer the base are female,
while those at the tip are male. The flower is one of the most
showy and curious of all Hawaii&rsquo;s blossoms.</p>
<p>It grows on a small plant, of typical Banana form, about
eight feet high, with large, lush leaves. This species is a native
of India. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>In handling this flower care should be taken not to let the
cut stalk touch clothing, as the juice leaves a permanent stain.</p>
<h3>SPATHIPHYLLUM
<br /><i>Spathiphyllum species</i></h3>
<p>A blossom like a small, white Anthurium, but more fragile
and with a large, rough spadix, is the Spathiphyllum. The leaves
of this plant grow about two feet high and are long, pointed,
blade-like and a very rich, dark green. The plant is much used
as a low-growing cover in shady tropical gardens, and in pots.
Unfortunately the exquisite white flowers do not last long when
cut, a day being about all that can be expected.</p>
<p>The species commonly grown around Honolulu is called
<i>Spathiphyllum clevelandii</i>, but this is a horticultural name and
does not appear in botanical literature. The local species has not
yet been satisfactorily determined. The plant is a member of the
Arum family and a native of tropical America. (<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>)</p>
<h3>DIEFFENBACHIA
<br /><i>Dieffenbachia seguine Schott</i></h3>
<p>Frequently seen in collections of tropical plants, on porches
or in greenhouses, and sometimes growing in the ground, are the
large, green and white leaves of the Dieffenbachias. The species
was named for J. F. Dieffenbach, a German botanist of the last
century. There are a number of varieties, which differ as to the
shape of the leaf blade and the pattern of white on them. One
of these is shown on the plate, the one most frequently grown in
Honolulu. The flowers are small and seldom seen. They are
made up of the spathe and spadix characteristic of the Arum
family.</p>
<p>The plant grows as a thick stalk which often lies on the
ground for a distance before lifting its head of leaves. The leaf
stems clasp this stalk and rings are left when they fall off. The
Dieffenbachias are natives of central and South America. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>

<h3>GREEN TI
<br /><i>Cordyline terminalis Kunth</i></h3>
<p>A plant which grows wild and very abundantly in the lower,
wet forests of Hawaii is called Ti by the Hawaiians, (pronounced
tea). It is primarily a leaf plant, the leaf blades being two or
three feet long and very glossy, thick, and strong in texture.
They do not wilt easily and so are useful for many things.
Shredded to the midrib and strung together, they form the green
skirt of the modern hula dancer. At native feasts they are used
to cover the table instead of a cloth and sections of the leaves
serve as plates. In some meat markets, sections of Ti leaf are used
instead of waxed paper to wrap up meat, while leis wrapped in
a bundle of leaves remain fresh for a long time. For culinary
purposes, pieces of fish and pork, along with young leaves of the
taro which taste like spinach, are wrapped in Ti leaves and steamed.
The resulting dish is called a lau-lau. The Ti leaf imparts a characteristic
flavor to the food it enwraps.</p>
<p>The Ti plant grows as a tall stalk, often woody at the base,
which may be twelve feet high. The leaves appear in a tuft at
the top of the stalk. From among these leaves in winter and
spring comes the flower cluster. The blossoms are very small and
tubular, really minute lilies, a creamy white in color, with sepals
that are mauve or pinkish, so that the effect is a mass of purplish
or pinkish grey and cream. The flower cluster is much branched
and very graceful, being attractive even when dried. The flowers
on the plant sometimes develop seed. The plant is much used in
gardens for hedges and for background plantings. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>
<p>A section of the old woody stem, several inches in diameter
and several inches long, if placed in a shallow bowl of water will
develop new shoots and become an attractive house plant.</p>
<p>The Ti grows on the South Sea islands, in India and Southern
China. It is a member of the lily family. It enters many Polynesian
myths and stories, for it was widely used by the ancient
islanders as well as by their modern descendents. The thick root
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
stock was used by early white men in Hawaii to make <i>okolehao</i>,
the starchy root being boiled, fermented and distilled.</p>
<h3>RED TI
<br /><i>Cordyline terminalis</i></h3>
<p>The Ti plant varies greatly, many forms having colored
foliage, and variously shaped leaves. The colors are mostly tones
of red and whitish green, the hues ranging from dark maroon to
bright pink while there are some with bronze and golden tones.
Usually the coloring appears as irregular strips along the line of
the veins. Such red foliage plants usually have cerise flowers and
red berries. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>
<h3>POTHOS. TARO VINE. PHILODENDRON
<br /><i>Scindapsus aureus Linden</i>
<br />(<i>Pothos aureus Linden</i>)</h3>
<p>The huge green and gold leaved creepers which envelop so
many coconut and other trees are called Taro Vine or Pothos by the
local people while they are often called Philodendron by newcomers.
The real Philodendron and Pothos are closely related and once
were botanically mixed. Probably the name Taro Vine was applied
because the large leaves suggest those of the Taro, which
is also a relative. Pothos clings to its support with strong, woody
roots which, however, do not draw nourishment from the host
plant, since it is not a parasite. In the sun, under normal conditions
the leaves are marked with gold, but when the vine grows
in the dark they remain green and small, seeming almost a different
plant. In this form it is often grown in water indoors.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arum family and a native of the
Solomon islands. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>
<h3>CALADIUM. VARIEGATED-LEAVED A&rsquo;PES
<br /><i>Caladium bicolor Ventonat</i></h3>
<p>Shady tropical gardens often make use of the colored Caladiums
to give color and they are also frequently seen growing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
pots. The heart-shaped leaves of these plants are marked with
red and light green in almost endless variations and designs, so
that they become a specialist&rsquo;s hobby. Some are blotched with
red and white; others have designs that are as fine as lace. The
plants grow from tubers, several leaves pushing up on long slender
stems. During part of the year these leaves die back and the
plant rests. Caladiums are members of the Arum family and
natives of tropical South America. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>
<h3>MONSTERA VINE
<br /><i>Monstera deliciosa Liebmann</i></h3>
<p>Large curious leaves with many natural holes in them, characterize
the Monstera vine which is often seen in Honolulu. On
mature plants the leaves are very large, thick, green and glossy.
They tend to a pinnate form, and holes in the leaves continue the
openings between the veins. The plant grows slowly, clinging
by aerial roots to a support. Some of these roots hang down
string-like, toward the ground.</p>
<p>Under favorable conditions the plant bears large, pinkish
flowers, in general form like those of the A&rsquo;pe illustrated on
<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>. The spathe is large, pinkish, thick, soft and flesh-like
in texture. It covers the spadix like a tent, but falls off
in a few days. The spadix holds the inconspicuous, densely packed
flowers which develop into many small berries, closely packed
together, so that the entire fruit, when mature, resembles a large
greenish cone. Its flavor is thought to be like that of pineapples
and bananas, probably inspiring the specific name of deliciosa.</p>
<p>This plant is a native of Mexico and Guatemala and a member
of the Arum family. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>
<h3>RHOEO. TRADESCANTIA
<br /><i>Rhoeo discolor Hance</i></h3>
<p>Stiff rosettes about a foot and a half high, made up of
pointed leaves which are purplish-red below and green above are
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
the Rhoeo or Tradescantia. This little plant grows so easily it is
seen in many gardens, adding color to shady corners. In the axils
of the leaves appears a boat-shaped, spathe-like growth in which
are the small white flowers. Each has three sepals and three petals.
The Rhoeo is a native of Mexico and the West Indies. It is a
relative of the Wandering Jew and belongs to the Commelina
family. (<a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)</p>
<h3>A&rsquo;PE
<br /><i>Alocasia macrorhiza Schott</i></h3>
<p>Very large, heart-shaped leaves, some of them on stems four
or five feet high, grow up from the rootstalk of the A&rsquo;pe plant.
The name (pronounced Ah-pay) is a Hawaiian word first applied
to a native species which has glossy, green leaves and greenish
yellow flowers. Another A&rsquo;pe (the one illustrated on <a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>)
has dull leaves and pinkish flowers. The strange flowers are a
foot long and have an unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>The A&rsquo;pes are closely related to the Taros (Colocasias) which
are the principle food plant of the Hawaiian people. The thick
root stalk of the taro is boiled and mashed, to become <i>poi</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
